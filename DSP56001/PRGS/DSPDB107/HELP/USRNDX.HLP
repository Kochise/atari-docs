{How to build a Help file}{ˆv 1.0}

	You can write what you want in the files, and index the
subjects you want.

	Topics are indicated by an opened parenthesis followed by
an extended VDI styles combination:
	bit 0:	{Bold}.			used for indexes.
	bit 1:	{Light}.
	bit 2:	{Italic}.
	bit 3:	{Underlined}.		used for titles.
	bit 4:	{Outlined}.
	bit 5:	No style.			because 0x0 is used for strings!
	bit 6:	Graphics. 			not implemented.
	bit 7:	Invisible text.		used for multi-indexes.

	You can also use tabs (help tab is always 4 spaces).

{EXAMPLE:}

{Brainstorm products} is underlined and must be used for titles.

{Adebug}	:	A wonderful low-level and TC source-level 680x0 debugger.
	is an index entry leading to the file USRDTA.HLP.
