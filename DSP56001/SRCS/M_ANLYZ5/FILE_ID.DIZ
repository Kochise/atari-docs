Music Analyzer (release 5, August 95)
for the Atari Falcon. Music Analyzer is
a small (not very usefull) program that
takes the incoming sound from the ADC and
uses the DSP to convert it into graphics,
which means: two scopes, a 2*14-band
spectrum analyzer and a left vs. right
scope. With mouse control (no GEM). All
source codes are included. Written by
