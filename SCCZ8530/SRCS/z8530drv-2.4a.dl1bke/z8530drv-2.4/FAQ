*  I have a question...

   Read the documentation included in this package, read this FAQ. If
   your problems cannot be solved, feel free to ask me. If you find
   something wrong, _tell me_, please don't complain to others. Please 
   report bugs, I'll fix them as soon as possible.


*  I tried to compile version 2.4 of this driver with Linux kernel 1.3.x or
   prior and it failed.

   Try Linux kernel version 2.0.0 or higher. Note that some things may
   change in 2.1.x and the driver may or may not compile...


*  I tried the utilities included in your package with the driver included
   in the Linux 2.0.0 (or prior) kernel source. They don't work.

   The ioctl-codes have changed. Upgrade linux/drivers/char/scc.c
   and linux/include/linux/scc.h with the versions in this package.


*  Sccinit complains about a missing /etc/z8530drv.rc but it's there...

   No, sccinit complains about /etc/z8530drv.conf missing. Just rename
   /etc/z8530drv.rc to /etc/z8530drv.conf.


*  Sccinit complains about "slip" unsupported now...

   Ignore it or remove the entries in /etc/z8530drv.conf


*  Sccstat shows that I've got NoSpace errors. What's that?

   Ignore it if you are running IP mode datagram, the value just
   says that a tx frame had to be discarded. If the value is
   very high and you are using IP virtual connect mode, or you
   aren't using IP over AX.25 at all, increase the amount of 
   transmission buffers.

*  Sccstat shows TxErrors. What exactly does this mean?

   Either a program that is using the TTY mode sent a bogus KISS frame,
   or (more likely) 'maxkeyup' expired. If you are using IP in datagram
   mode you should increase TCP IRTT (see 'man route') and perhaps 
   'maxkeyup', too.


*  Maxkeyup behaves funny, the first time the PTT stays up for
   'maxkeyup' seconds and the driver resumes transmission after
   'mintime' correctly, the second time it goes down after few
   seconds, starts transmission again immediately and keys down
   after three seconds again.

   Avoid the driver running into transmission timeouts, if possible
   (see last question). This phenomena is a bit complicated to
   explain, basicly the hardware watchdog for RTS on your MODEM
   interferes with the software watchdog. It is not for the short 
   drop of the PTT, though. But: something is wrong with the timing
   parameters of the network or link layer if you see this behaviour.


*  I'm getting the message
	z8530drv: rx buffer pool for scc3 empty
   what's wrong?

   Ignore it. You received more frames the AX.25 layer can handle and 
   the oldest one was discarded. If you get bombarded with this message
   increase the amount of receive buffers.


*  Why are you using your own buffer concept anyway?

   To keep things portable to other OS. I'm still dreaming of a
   port to OS/2, but if I could only find the time...


*  The driver does not find the SCC ports.

   Check the command and data register addresses.


*  The register addresses are correct, it still does not find the ports.

   You are using a PE1PET card, right? This, and some other concepts,
   "forget" to delay the IORDY signal, thus the driver must insert
   some wait states itself. #define SCC_DELAY in scc.c. This is not
   defined by default, I am not willing to do the dirty work for
   lazy hardware designers.


*  Help, the driver finds my card, but it won't generate interrupts.

   Are you sure you specified the right IRQ? Have you tried to #define
   SCC_DELAY?


*  On transmission the PTT remains keyed for maxkeyup seconds,
   sccstat shows exactly one tx interrupt. Receive is okay.

   Check the "clock" entry in /etc/z8530drv.conf. You probably 
   specified the wrong clock source. Try "DPLL" for a start. 
   If this doesn't help, #define SCC_DELAY in scc.c.


*  The PTT only occasionally remains keyed for maxkeyup seconds, 
   everything else seems to be okay, apart from some transmission 
   underruns

   This appears to be a bug of the Z8530. It sometimes doesn't
   generate the ABORT interrupt when an underrun occurs. 


*  Other stations sometimes have problems to decode my frames. Under
   DOS everything is okay. Sccstat shows nothing special.

   Increase txdelay and tailtime by 1 (10 msec). This has technical
   reasons. Linux has a timer granulity of 10 msec (at least for
   i386 architectures), thus setting "tailtime" to 10 msec means 
   the timer routine gets called with the next timer tick,
   happens most likely before the 10 millisecods have expired.


*  Axattach complains about "TIOCSETD: Invalid argument"

   You forgot to compile SLIP into the kernel (or the "insmod slip").
   Why are you using the KISS TNC emulation anyway? Z8530drv supports
   network devices now.
