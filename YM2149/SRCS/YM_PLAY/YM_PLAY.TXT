YM PLAYER by The Beast/Typhoon (St‚phane Perez)
---------

This is a very early version (0.1) for YM files.
It only plays "YM2!" and "YM3!" files for the
moment, and there are maybe some bad sounds because
of the YM's register 13...

This player is freeware. It is written in GFA
Basic 3.5. The source code is available, just
tell me if you're programming another player
using this source, or if you're optimising
this source. Thanks!
