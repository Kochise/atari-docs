<H1>The AY-3-8910/8912 sound synthesizer IC</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>The AY-3-8910/8912 is a sound generator IC containing three tone generators
and a white noise generator. In addition to its sound producing capabilities,
the AY-3-8910 has two 8-bit I/O ports and the AY-3-8912 has one.</P>

<P>DA0-DA7 are multiplexed data and address lines, as used in the range of GI
processors that this IC was originally part of. The BC1 and BDIR pins are
used to control the IC as follows:</P>

<PRE>
Function       BDIR   BC1
	
Inactive         0     0
Read             0     1
Write            1     0
Latch address    1     1
</PRE>

<P>In addition to using BC1 and BDIR, A8 should be taken high to enable the
chip. IOA0-IOA7 are the input/output pins (the AY-3-8910 has an additional
set marked IOB0-IOB7). The IC does not contain an internal oscillator - the
clock input to the CLK pin should fall between 1MHz-2MHz, so a typical Z80
system's clock would need to be divided.</P>

<H2>Registers</H2>

<P>The AY-3-8910/8912 contains 16 internal registers as follows:</P>

<H3>Notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI>The AY-3-8912 does not contain register 15.
<LI>The volume registers (8, 9 and 10) contain a 4-bit setting but if bit
    5 is set then that channel uses the envelope defined by register 13 and
    ignores its volume setting.
<LI>The mixer (register 7) is made up of the following bits (low=enabled):

<PRE>
Bit: 7        6        5        4        3        2        1        0
   _         _
   I/O       I/O   Noise    Noise    Noise     Tone     Tone     Tone
     B        A        C        B        A        C        B        A
</PRE>
    The AY-3-8912 ignores bit 7 of this register.
</UL>

<H2>Envelopes</H2>

<P>The AY-3-8910/8912 contains the following preset envelopes or waveforms (set
using control register 13). Note that these affect volume only and not the
pitch:</P>

<PRE>
 0      \__________     single decay then off

 4      /|_________     single attack then off

 8      \|\|\|\|\|\     repeated decay

 9      \__________     single decay then off

10      \/\/\/\/\/\     repeated decay-attack
	  _________
11      \|              single decay then hold

12      /|/|/|/|/|/     repeated attack
	 __________
13      /               single attack then hold

14      /\/\/\/\/\/     repeated attack-decay

15      /|_________     single attack then off
</PRE>

<H2>Pitch values</H2>

<P>The course and fine pitch registers for each channel are used in the
following fashion (assuming channel A):</P>

<P>Registers 0 and 1 operate together to form channel A's final pitch. The eight
least significant bits are sent to register 0 and the four most significant
bits are sent to register 1. The output frequency is equal to the IC's
incoming clock frequency divided by 16 and then further divided by the number
written to the course and fine pitch registers, so the higher the number
written to these, the lower the pitch. For example, if a frequency of 1KHz
was required and the IC's clock frequency was 1MHz, a total division rate
of 1000 would be needed. The sound generator itself divides by 16 so the
course and fine pitch registers must provide a further division by 62.5 (due
to the fact that 1000/16 is 62.5). A division rate of 62 or 63 will be
accurate enough, since the registers can only store whole numbers. Therefore,
62 or 63 would be written to register 0 and 0 would be written to register
1.</P>

<H2>Applications</H2>

<P>The AY-3-8910/8912 (and derivatives) has found its way into a variety of
home computers and games consoles including the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128/+2/+3
<LI>Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128
<LI>Mattel Intellivision
<LI>BBC Micro
<LI>Atari ST
<LI>Sega Master System
</UL>

<P>There are also a few AY emulators available at the time of writing:</P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../emulator.html#z80">Z80</A> - The Spectrum emulator by Gerton
    Lunter for PCs and compatibles which utilises the Adlib sound generator
    present on most Soundblaster-compatible cards. This package fully emulates
    the Spectrum 48/128 (apart from 4-bit sample output) and is well worth
    looking at.
<LI>DeliAY - by Patrik Rak for the Commodore Amiga. This comes as
    an add-on for "DeliTracker" (a music player) and emulates a Z80
    and AY-3-8912 (in a Spectrum-like fashion) giving very accurate
    results. A growing number of Spectrum tunes are being gathered
    together to run under this player.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.mygale.org/09/leonard/index.html">YM Player</A> and
    converter tool (from Z80 .out files). Lots of tunes at the site too.

<P>So, to produce a simple sound from BASIC ...</P>

<CODE>
<PRE>
	10 LET ayctrl=65533
	20 LET aydata = 49149
	30 OUT ayctrl,7 : REM select the mixer register
	40 OUT aydata,62 : REM enable channel A only
	50 OUT ayctrl,1 : REM channel A course pitch
	60 OUT aydata,50 : REM set it
	70 OUT ayctrl,8 : REM channel A volume
	80 OUT aydata,15 : REM set it to maximum
</PRE>
</CODE>

<P>... or from assembler ...</P>

<PRE>
	ayctrl  EQU     65533
	aydata  EQU     49149

	start   ld      d,7             ; select the mixer register
		ld      e,62            ; enable channel A only
		call    outer           ; send it to PSG
		ld      d,1             ; channel A course pitch
		ld      e,50            ; pitch value
		call    outer           ; send it to PSG
		ld      d,8             ; channel A volume
		ld      e,15            ; maximum

	outer   ld      bc,ayctrl       ; select control port

		ld      bc,aydata       ; select data port
		out     (c),e           ; send specified value

</PRE>

<P>For an easy way to generate the required course and fine pitch values, try
the following program:</P>

<PRE>
	10 INPUT "Note value ",n
	20 INPUT "Octave ",o
	30 LET f=INT(n/2^o)
	40 LET c=INT(f/256)
	50 PRINT "Fine = ";f;"  Course = ";c
</PRE>

<P>The pitch values required by this program are as follows:</P>
