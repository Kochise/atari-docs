                               SOUND MACHINE III
                               =================


     Welcome intro the Sound Machine documentation and thanks for reading it
because, as you have probably noticed it, nobody usually reads documentations.
That's why I've written several files instead of a big one. So, it will be
easier for you.

     Here are the different documentations :

- SMACHINE : it describes the dialog boxes
- FORMATS : the list of the formats recognized and/or played
- SMFORMAT : informations sur le format interne de Sound Machine
- POSTCARD : informations about registering yourself to Sound Machine and about
  copyrights

     You'll also find a little program called CHIPFALC.PRG, its aim is to allow
the Falcon to play soundchips (and only soundchips) in stereo thanks to the DSP.
This little musical hack was made by Nullos/DNT Crew and I thank him very much.


                                And don't forget Sound Machine is postcardware !
