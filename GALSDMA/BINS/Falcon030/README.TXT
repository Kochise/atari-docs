These files are the custom GAL set that is present on the Atari 
Falcon.  All five are included, four near the CPU (U62, U63, U67, 
U68) and one near the DSP (U44).

U62, U63, U67, U68 are 16V8
U44 is 20v8

15ns GALs seem to work fine, unsure of the original speed (12ns?)

Also included is partially reverse engineered files, back to their 
Boolean expressions for anyone wanting to know the timing/inside 
working of the GALs.

Should program fine on any GAL programmer.  I used a Maxon GAL 
programmer on my Atari STE.
