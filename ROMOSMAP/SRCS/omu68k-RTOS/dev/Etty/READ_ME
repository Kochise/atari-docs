*		TTY handler			T.Barnaby 7/6/85
******************************************************************************

The tty handler in this directory has been made to simulate the
Codata one in most respects (including nastys at the moment).
It can drive either polled or interupt driven devices, in any
configuration.
The main files are:-

	tty.c		Main section of the tty handler common for all
			machines.

	ttyc.c		TTY minor device switch, contains addresses
			of device dependent routines

	acia.c		Device dependent routines for Eltec boards
			acia's

 
 Implements :-

 	RAW, CBREAK, ECHO, CRMOD, TANDEM, XTABS, CRDELAY
 
 	Knows about special characters (erase, kill, start,
 		stop, interupt, quit, eof, input delim).
 
 	Does Xon, Xoff  properly ?
 
 	Full 8 bits in RAW, 7 bits masked on all other inputs
 		8 bits on all outputs
 
 	No parity checking performed, tested, done, thought about
 		etc etc ...
 
 	Baud rates settable as per Codata On output speed only.
 
 	Most Ioctls work except TIOCEXCL, TIOCNXLL and TIOCHPCL.
 
 	CR and NL delays included with simple loop timmer (delaym())
 		NL1 is set to around 5ms
 
 	Quit, and interupt not implemented as yet
 
	NOTE putchar(), and getchar() are included in here
	for kernel error comunication. These are polled outputs
	regardless of the type of device.
 
 NOTE	At the moment the extending of characters on output
 	(CRMOD, XTABS etc), is done when an interupt or
 	the next character is required from the buffer.
 	This means that the extra characters added are
 	polled out even when in interupt mode.
 	CR, and NL delays are done here.
