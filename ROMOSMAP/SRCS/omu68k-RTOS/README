The OMU Kernel was written to provide a cut-down Unix-like O/S for a
home-made 6809-based home computer built by me, Steven Hosgood, in the
early 1980s. This package contains the RTOS version of omu68k, derived
from a port of the original 6809 code to the 68000 done by Terry Barnaby
and me.

The basic 68000 OMU added a certain amount of multi-tasking, hard disk support
and bothers to support the UID/GID fields of the filestore - none of which
the 6809 version had. This RTOS variant features changes to the signal
handling which proved useful for research into "virtual instruments" done
by Terry Barnaby and others in the dept. of Electrical and Electronic
Engineering at Swansea University in the mid to late 1980s.

It should still be able to work, but getting it to do so is up to you!
There is no top-level makefile, and the lower-level makefiles probably
won't work without tweaking. 

The FreeDOS project have a useful-looking generic boot system for PCs, plus
a C-compiler. That's where I would start...... Bear in mind that the
original compiler that was used treated 'int' as 16-bit signed and 'char'
as 8-bit signed. It also packed structs such that multi-byte quantities
always started on even addresses.

I offer up these sources for the amusement of experimenters and wish you
all best wishes in getting it working. I can offer no technical support
and no guarantees of suitability for any particular job. However, I would be
glad to receive feedback from anyone who does get it going, and would be
happy to add mention of successful experiments onto my WWW page.

If you ship me runnable binaries or offer me sources for new drivers or
other such things I will be happy to make them downloadable from my
WWW page(s) too.

Happy Experimenting!
