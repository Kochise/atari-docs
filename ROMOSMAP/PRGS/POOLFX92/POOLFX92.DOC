File purpose:	Document release of POOLFX92.PRG

Since 'Poolfix' has been around for quite a while you may find it hard
to believe that it still contained two quite dangerous bugs:

  1:  The safe compaction of freed RAM was never made for the gendos
      function 'Mshrink', even though it is necessary in some cases.
      This error may cause the ROM bug to BOMB your ST.

  2:  The "safe" compaction itself, which is called for ANY gemdos
      function following a RAM release, would often trash register 'd1'
      even though all functions except 'Super' are specified to restore
      d1 to the value it had on entry to the function.
      This error may cause error-free programs to BOMB your ST.

In short, these versions provided a NEW way to BOMB your ST, and this
without even fully eliminating the original bug in ROM.

I have scanned the code both of 'Poolfix3.Prg' and of 'Poolfix4.Prg'
and have seen that both these errors exist in them.  'Poolfix4.Prg'
also has another error which may cause BOMBs when programs need their
own reset-routines linked in.

Since I need a remedy for the ROM bug, I obviously had to make this new
version of 'Poolfix'.  I have named it 'Poolfx92.Prg' so no doubt shall
exist of what version is most recent, and this should be the final
version.  I really have TRIED to make it BOMB, but it wouldn't !!!

Since this code is based on that of two other authors, I obviously have
no copyright claims to make.  This is still FREEWARE, although ATARI
of course owns the copyright.

I have chosen to release the source code for my own version, as well as
that for the two other versions mentioned above.  These files are in
format suitable for Devpac 2.  They are found with the original 'DOCs'
in folder 'Poolfix', and some definition files are in folder 'TOS'.

These sources are provided mainly so that any user should be able to
see for himself what I have done, in case of doubt.

I strongly recommend that any 'archives' of this program should include
both this document, and the older ones, to keep things perfectly legal.
Unfortunately most "Sysop's" do not realize that removing or changing
a file that holds a program's copyright notice may be against the law,
unless they also remove the program itself from any public access.

I hope you all find this version useful!
