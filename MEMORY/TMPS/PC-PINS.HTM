This is a list of the pinouts to the more common PC hardware
interfaces.  It is by no means complete.  While I have taken care not
to make any mistakes, I urge you to take caution when using these
tables.  Also, please keep in mind that these are only tables, they
are not a guide to hardware hacking and do not attempt to explain
drive capabilities, signal timings, handling care, or other interface
issues.  As always, make sure you know what you're doing before you
start hooking wires to your PC.

Q) 8.2  *Where are benchmark programs located. What do they mean?

Q) 8.3  What is Plug and Play?

[From: leefi@microsoft.com (Lee Fisher)]

Plug and Play is the name of a technology that lets PC hardware and attached
devices work together automatically, reducing end-user complexity. Plug and
Play technology is implemented in hardware, in operating systems, and in
supporting software such as drivers and in the systemboard's BIOS. Microsoft
will support Plug and Play starting with Windows "Chicago" and Windows NT
"Cairo". Today there is a solution for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.x using
software from Intel which works with the Plug and Play hardware. There are a
variety of Plug and Play technologies, today including BIOS, ISA cards, SCSI,
IDE CD-ROM, PCMCIA, drivers.

Many specifications are available via anonymous ftp at 
ftp.microsoft.com:/drg/Plug-and-Play.

Email the PlayList@Microsoft.COM alias to get on a list for announcements
regarding new specifications, informations on workshops, etc.

The Compuserve Plug and Play forum (GO PLUGPLAY) is available for technical
support issues regarding hardware and driver design issues.

Q) 8.4  What is an OEM product?
[From: scott@bme.ri.ccf.org (Michael Scott)]

OEM versions of may computer products including keyboards, CDROM drives,
video and sound cards, modems, monitors, popular software packages and
more are available, either as parts of a computer system purchase, or as
individual items.  If you are considering a purchase of any OEM hardware
or software, it's important that you understand what you are buying.

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer.  OEM's exist in most
major industries;  Chrysler sells cars made by Mitsubishi, and all of
Sear's Kenmore products are made by OEM companies.  The main difference
in the computer industry is that OEM products are usually less expensive
than the retail versions supplied by the manufacturer.  However, there
are different types of OEM products.

Some manufacturers have two versions of their products;  one retail version
which ships in fancy packaging, and an OEM version which is sold in bulk
(usually to system manufacturers).  OEM products are not intended for
individual sale, and so don't include a glossy box, and often don't include
a manual or driver disks (if req'd).

Sometimes, the OEM versions are functionally identical to the original
retail version, but not always.  Often, a large system manufacturer will
specify particular features in an OEM product which are not the same as
the retail version.  For example, Matrox supplies OEM video cards to
a large manufacturer (i.e. Compaq's QVision 2000+ video card).  Because of
the large numbers purchased, Compaq gets a good price, and also
specifies things like:  amount of video RAM, upgradability, RAMDAC speed,
etc.  Part of the deal is usually that Compaq will take over responsibility
for the hardware warranty.

Hypothetically, say that Matrox makes 10000 extra units in anticipation of
Compaq's next order, with a few small BIOS tweaks for compatibility with
Compaq's machines.  Compaq decides they only need 8000 units this quarter,
so Matrox sells the extra 2000 units as OEM.  Once those units go out of
the factory, they're no longer Matrox's responsiblity, and probably don't
even have Matrox stamped on them anywhere.

I'm just using Matrox and Compaq for illustrative purposes here, but
component manufacturers commonly provide OEM versions of their products
for systems manufacturers.  i.e. ATI, Tseng and Cirrus Logic provide
chipsets for integration onto motherboards.

Sometimes, the difference between a retail version and the equivalent OEM
is negligible, i.e. the packaging.  However, more commonly the OEM version
has been made with less expensive components, includes no software or
hardware 'freebies' or extras, includes no hardware warranty, etc.

So, be careful when buying OEM that you are getting what you _think_ you
are getting.  You may be saving $20-30 and get a slower RAMDAC or a unit
that isn't upgradable.  On the other hand, you may be one of the
thousands of people who have good success with their OEM products and
saved some money at the same time.

Often, the OEM (original manufacturer) will not provide any tech support
or warranty service for OEM units.


Q) 8.5  What size should I set my DOS partitions to be?
[From: Mike Long &lt;mike.long@analog.com&gt;]
[Some corrections by: Osmo Ronkanen &lt;ronkanen@cc.helsinki.fi&gt;]

This depends on what cluster size you want.  A smaller cluster size is
better, because a small file takes up a whole cluster if there is even
one byte in it; the leftover space is called "slack."  If you have N
files on your drive, and your cluster size is S bytes, then you can
expect to lose N*S/2 bytes to slack space on the average.

The table below shows the maximum partition size to get clusters of a
given size.  You cannot format a hard drive under DOS with a cluster
size less than 2K.

Another consideration is backup.  If you backup to tape, you should
have disk partitions smaller than the capacity of a single tape for
ease in backup.

[From: Osmo Ronkanen &lt;ronkanen@cc.helsinki.fi&gt;]

The 32 MB limit actually didn't have anything to do with the
cluster size or FAT it was because the number of sectors in
the partition was stored in boot record as a 16 bit number. 


Q) 8.6  How do I get DOS to letter my devices the way I want?

The first floppy drive will always be A:, the second floppy drive will
always be B:.  If there is no second floppy, B: will also point to A:.

DOS will assign drive letters C: and up in the following order:

Primary DOS partition on each BIOS supported drive
  (Master, Slave, EIDE ch2 Master, EIDE ch2 Slave)
All logical drives in the Extended DOS partition on each BIOS supported drive
  (Master, Slave, EIDE ch2 Master, EIDE ch2 Slave)
Device drivers in CONFIG.SYS, in order, unless over ridden
Device drivers in AUTOEXEC.BAT, in order, unless over ridden

This table can be used to add drives without reordering drive letters.
For instance, if you have a Master drive with a Primary and Extended
DOS partition and you add a second (Slave) drive with a Primary DOS
partition, all of your extended partitions will be re-lettered.  If,
however, you only place an extended partition on the new drive, all
partitions on the Master will be assigned letters first.

Some device drivers, such as MSCDEX, have command line switches to
specify an unused drive letter rather than the next open one.  It is
usually a good idea to set these to a higher drive letter right off
rather than having to reinstall all of your software after adding
another drive.


Q) 8.7  Why won't my system boot from the hard drive?

If you can boot from a floppy and see the files on your hard drive,
then chances are there's something wrong with your MBR (Master Boot
Record) / partition table.  The first thing you should try is: "FDISK
/MBR".  This will fix the master boot record without effecting the
contents of your disk.  If this doesn't work, the next thing to try is
verifying that you have your Primary DOS Partition set active.  To do
this, enter "FDISK" and chose "Set active partition" (usually the
second option) then pick "Primary DOS Partition".  Then exit and
reboot.  This too will not effect the contents of your disk.

The next thing to try is replacing the files required for DOS to boot;
they may have been corrupted or deleted.  To do this, run "SYS C:".
This may or may not be possible as DOS versions before 5.0 required
these files be located at a certain place on your hard drive and that
spot may no longer be available.  Either way, this will not otherwise
effect the contents of your disk.

If neither of these things work, then the next thing to try is
reformatting your hard drive (FORMAT C: /SYS).  Note that this will
erase all of the files on your hard drive, so back up anything you
want to save first!!!  If all three of these suggestions fail, then
chances are you have a more serious problem.

Q) 8.8  How do I clean my computer?

Clean the outside with a damp (not wet) cloth with a mild dish washing
detergent after unplugging the system.  Let it dry completely before
plugging your system in.  Do not clean the inside - computer
components are not susceptible to common house hold dust.  Unless you
have special equipment, you will more likely cause more harm than help
to your computer if you try.

Q) 8.11  What tape backup software is available?

[From: herbst@techunix.technion.ac.il (Herbst OMR)]

 JUMBO TAPE
 ----------
Small. Not many features but does the job. Seems to work only with
Colorado drives.  Latest version is 4.03 and can be found by Archie
jumbo403.zip.

&gt;From "Stan Faullin":
 
Useful DOS program.  Has very basic Backup (total, modified,
selected), Restore, Compare, Erase and Format functions.  Some
versions come with a Windows scheduler, but it will NOT run in the
background in a DOS window.  The compression scheme used in some
previous versions is NOT compatible with their latest release, so you
may not be able to read backups made with version 3.x with version
4.x.  Separate versions of this software are available for their
internal model or the parallel port model.
 
Windows:
 
The Lite version supports both parallel port versions and internal
versions.  The only Windows backup program for a parallel port device,
but only supports the Colorado Trakker unit.  Can run in the
background. Can be found by Archie, cbwlite.exe.
 
&gt;From "gregb@oclflt.den.mmc.com (gregb)":
 
CMS Trakker 250 is supplied with a "generic" software package:
it performs backup, restore, selective backup &amp; restore, compression,
compare. It works with DOS and Windows 3.1. 
For an additional $49.95 ($39?) you can purchase their fancier version.
 
 Central-Point backup
 --------------------
Large with many, many features and confusing directory
selections. Works with most drives.

 Conner Basic 1.0
 ----------------
&gt;From "Moshe Braner   braner@emba.uvm.edu":
useless -- only backs up entire drive.
 
 Conner Basic 1.1
 ----------------
&gt;From: pjk@netcom.com (Phil Koenig)

If you got the low-power backup software bundled in -- Conner Backup
Basics -- and it is V1.0, you are entitled to a free upgrade from Conner.
The new version has an only slightly better addendum to the manual, but
the software now is about as flexible as most users would want -- partial
backup and restore by directory or file, etc.  It has worked well for us,
and I recommend that you ask for your copy.
 
&gt;From: dmiller@im.lcs.mit.edu (Dick and Jill Miller)
 
I emphasize that v1.1 of Conner Backup Basics fixes many of the prior
problems, although its prompts, on-line help and printed documentation 
still deserve improvement.
 
 Conner Exec
 -----------
&gt;From "Moshe Braner   braner@emba.uvm.edu":
 
Very large (2.5 megs for DOS version, windows version even larger).
Did not work with my parallel-port Conner 250meg QIC-80 drive.

 QICstream==Conner "Simply Safe Software Backup Basics version 3.0P"
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
Small and works fine. Works with parallel port Conner drive.
 
 Symantec Norton Backup
 ----------------------
This is included with Norton Desktop for Windows, which is a much
better deal than purchasing Norton Backup for Windows alone.
 
 Symantec Norton Backup for Windows

Q) 8.12  Why doesn't my new device work as fast as it should?

The performance of individual components in your system are highly
dependent the rest of your system.  For instance, the transfer rate of
drives, usually measured in megabytes per second, can depend on the
drive controller, bus type and OS.  Video card speed, sometime
measured in Winmarks, highly depends on the speed of your main CPU as
well as the OS.  When ever you see a statement on the speed of the
device, be sure to check the small print to determine what type of
system and under what conditions the speed was measured.  Don't be
fooled by benchmark numbers.  Another important corollary of this is
*never* post benchmarks - they offer little to no information for
comparison with other systems.  Benchmarks are only useful for
comparison purposes when run in a controlled environment, and even
then to a limited degree.

Q) 8.13  My drive lists a MTBF of 300,000 hours. Will it really last 34 years?

[From: swwalters@fl51mail.space.honeywell.com  (Steve Walters)]

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is a statistical calculation
indicating the mean time between randomly occurring hardware failures.
Two parameters are necessary to fully describe how long a piece of
hardware will last.  The first parameter is MTBF which is a measure of
frequency in which random hardware failures will occur.  The second
parameter is mean operating life which defines how long the hardware
will last before an anticipated wearout phenomena will occur.  These
two parameters combined together give the true projection of the
'real' life of the drive.  As an example of how these parameters
interrelate, assume your drive has an MTBF of 300,000 hours and an
operating life of 5 years.  The drive will operate uninterrupted until
failure (such as a file server, for example).  This is telling you
that your drive should be very reliable until wearout occurs since the
MTBF greatly exceeds the mean life.  However, after 5 years (on the
average), expect it to fail due to wearout.  In this example, the
actual chances of the drive lasting 3 years is 92%, 4 years is 88%, 5
years is 56% and 6 years is 35%.

Q) 8.14  How do I find pin 1 on my chip/card/cable/connector?

Pin 1 is always marked in one way or another to avoid confusion due to
symmetry (after which known numbering schemes can be used).  The most
important thing to note is that the orientation of the letters or
numbers printed on the chip have absolutely nothing to do with the
actual orientation of the pins.  Never assume that all chips should be
readable from the same angle!

The most obvious marking for pin 1 is a small number '1'.  The first
thing you should do is look very carefully for it.  Ribbon cables are
often marked with a blue or red stripe on pin 1.  Some chips are
marked with a dot, notch or small angled cut in the material just
above pin 1.  Rectangular chips are usually marked with a notch on one
of ends; the first pin counter clockwise from this notch is pin 1.  If
you can't find a marking on the socket or connector, then try looking
at the pads (the holes in the board the socket or connector is
soldered into).  For through-hole devices, pin 1 has a square pad, the
rest should be round.

Q) 8.15  I've run out of power connectors, what can I do?

Assuming your power suply is actually strong enough to power all of
your devices, you can pick up a Y-adapter at your local Radio Shack.

Q) 8.16  What does FCC approval cover and what needs to be approved?
[From: scharf@mirage.nsc.com (Steve Scharf)]

                      FCC Part 15 EMI Certification
                                  and
                     UL/CSA/TUV Safety Certification

FCC Part 15 Certification of Computer Equipment
-----------------------------------------------
The basic thing to understand is that SYSTEMS are certified, Not individual 
circuit boards (though in most cases add-on cards ARE certified), not 
motherboards, not cases, and not power supplies.

Class A &amp; B
-----------
Class A is for systems that will be used only in a commercial environment. 
Class A is more lax than Class B.

Class B is stricter, and is for systems that will be used in a home.

A manufacturer cannot simply declare that a system is not intended for home 
use and test to the more lax Class A limits (believe me, they tried this). A 
high end file server with a RAID array of drives and multiple network 
connections would qualify for Class A. A simple Pentium 100 desktop or Power 
PC would not.

FCC Certified Peripherals and Add-On Cards
------------------------------------------
Most add-on cards and peripherals (disk drives, floppy drives, CD-ROM 
drives, tape drives, etc.) have their own FCC certification. This is so they 
can be sold separately. They would technically not need to be certified 
separately if the system in which they are installed is certified as a unit.

Once a SYSTEM has passed FCC certification, a manufacturer may swap or add 
FCC certified cards and peripherals and retain compliance even though the 
system may technically exceed the limit with the different peripherals. I 
believe the FCC still has the right to demand that the system be in actual 
compliance with the emissions limits.

Motherboards
------------
The FCC has twice considered requiring motherboards be FCC certified and has 
twice rejected the idea. Of course there is great appeal to system 
manufacturers of this concept. Once a system is certified, the manufacturer 
could swap everything except the case and power supply and not have to re-
test.

The problem with this concept is that there could be no guarantee that the 
case that the motherboard was ultimately installed in, would be as good as 
the one that it was originally certified in. It would be easy to manufacture 
a very EMI tight case at great expense, inside which nearly any motherboard 
could pass. I don't believe ANY 386 or greater class of motherboard could 
pass outside of a case.

The Independent Testing Labs were very vocal against the certification of 
motherboards since it would have seriously affected their business.

Power Supplies and Cases
------------------------
Power supplies and cases are NOT FCC certified.

Keyboards and Mice
------------------
These are not required to be certified seperately if they are sold as part 
of a system, but in most cases they are certified separately so they can be 
sold separately.

Monitors, Printers, Externally Powered Peripherals
--------------------------------------------------
Each has their own certification. It actually has gotten very difficult to 
manufacture monitors that can meet Class B. This is why so many monitors 
have the plastic enclosed ferrite bead on the interface cable.

Swapping Motherboards, Power Supplies, and Cases.
-------------------------------------------------
You may not swap motherboards, power supplies, or cases, without re-
certification.

Bare Bones Systems
------------------
Some motherboard manufacturers sell 'bare bones' systems. This is 
the motherboard, power supply, and case, that has been FCC certified with 
some add-on cards and peripherals. The reseller can add any certified add-on 
cards and peripherals and retain compliance. For each new motherboard they 
recertify the bare bones system. 

The bare bones system concept has not been very successful in the chop shop 
type stores. This is because the bare bones systems cannot use the lowest 
quality and cheapest case and power supply, and thus costs several dollars 
more than what a chop shop normally uses. The bare bones systems are also 
sometimes UL and CSA certified which necessitates better quality (and thus 
more costly) power supplies and cases.

How Add-On Card Makers Certify Their Cards.
-------------------------------------------
What all add-on card makers do, is to certify their cards in a 'golden' 
system; a system with an excellent low noise (often low speed) motherboard 
and a high quality well shielded case and power supply. It isn't their 
problem to certify cards in a crappy and noisy system. The original IBM AT 
running at 6 Mhz is a popular system for certifying add-on cards, though of 
course this doesn't work anymore with PCI or VL bus cards.

How System Vendors Certify Their Systems.
-----------------------------------------
What most system makers do is to certify their systems with the lowest noise 
add-on cards and peripherals they can find. Then they can swap in any FCC 
certified add-on cards and peripherals.

Thus the system you buy may legally be FCC certified even though it is over 
the emission limits. I think the FCC has built in leeway into the 
requirements to allow for this. I think that the FCC still has the right to 
insist that such a system meet the actual limits, but I doubt if they ever 
do anything about it.

How All The Small Stores Comply with FCC Part 15
------------------------------------------------
Most small chop shop stores simply do not certify their systems. They are 
violating federal law and they usually get away with it since the FCC has 
very limited resources to enforce their rules. 

The problem is actually solving itself as buyers become more educated. The 
systems assembled by the small stores are usually lower quality, often 
higher priced, and lack the warranty support of the systems sold by the top 
and middle tier vendors.

What About Build-It-Yourself
----------------------------
There is no certification requirement for do-it-yourself systems. However if 
their is a complaint lodged against you and the FCC investigates and finds 
you to be the cause of excessive emissions, then they can take action 
against you.

UL/ETL/CSA/TUV Safety Certification
-------------------------------
UL-Underwriters Laboratories
CSA-Canadian Standards Association
TUV-German Safety Agency.
ETL-Electronic Testing Laboratories

These are product safety agencies. Most top tier systems are UL (or 
ETL)/CSA/TUV approved. Each agency now is supposed to inspect to the same 
international standards, but some policies are different in each agency.

The approval process is pretty simple despite all the requirements, but it 
can be costly so the cost needs to be amortized over a lot of systems. 

This is a partial list of the requirements:

No high voltages can be accessible to the user, so the power switch may have 
no exposed contacts (this is a problem on some cheap cases). This is why the 
original PCs had a power supply with an integral switch on the side, and why 
the PS/2 had a front switch that was mechanically linked to the switch on 
the power supply by a long steel rod

The power supply must be UL/CSA/TUV approved (low quality power supplies 
cannot pass this approval so this is a good indication of at least minimal 
quality of a power supply).

All peripherals powered by the system must have fuses in the power lines. 
This means PS/2 mice and all keyboards. They don't want a short in the 
keyboard or mouse setting the cable on fire (this is ridiculous, since the 
power supply would shut down if the +5volts was shorted to ground, but it is 
still a requirement).

The lithium battery must be double protected against being charged by the 
system. Two diodes are typically used for this.

All circuit board materials must meet flame ratings.

Proper labeling of power connections, fuses, and switches is required.

There are limitations on the colors of switches and lamps, i.e. no red LEDs 
(which indicate danger).

All peripherals must be approved separately.

A 'finger' test to be sure that fingers cannot touch moving parts like fans 
is performed.

The agency will test the system FULLY LOADED with peripherals and load 
boards to simulate maximum power supply load. Afterwards, depending on the 
agency, you can swap approved peripherals. UL requires that you submit a 
list of which approved peripherals you will swap and investigates every one 
to be sure that current limits are not exceeded. CSA and TUV do not require 
this. UL is a royal pain, since there are so many different peripherals, and 
so many new ones are being introduced.

All plastics must be approved. The agency will attempt to set the unit on 
fire.

Towers are subject to a 'tip test,' which necessitates the use of bases on 
the case. Tower PC's are especially poorly designed for the tip test since 
all the heaviest components are at the top.

You must perform certain test procedures on each system to check shock 
hazards. This is called Hi-Pot testing. The test machines must be calibrated 
periodically.

You must affix proper labels, and there are very strict requirements on the 
materials, the ink, the logos, etc.

The agency will inspect your factory and then conduct periodic and/or random 
inspections to ensure that you are complying with all the rules.

Do You need these Safety Approvals?
-----------------------------------
In the United States there is no federal requirement that electrical 
equipment be approved. Some counties and cities DO have this requirement. 
Most recognize UL, ETL, or CSA, and some may recognize others as well.

Some bare bones systems have UL/CSA approval, but since UL must approve a 
system's peripherals as they change, it is uncommon. Some manufacturers are 
getting just CSA since it is valid in most places in the U.S. that require 
certification.

Companies that export systems to Canada and Europe must have the appropriate 
approvals.

As you would expect, very very few, if any, chop shops can get these safety 
approvals. In reality, the systems they build would be pretty close to 
passing, providing they use the proper power supplies and switches, since 
nearly all motherboards and peripherals meet the proper requirements.

The safety approvals do usually ensure a modicum of quality, since no fly-
by-night factory could hope to meet the safety standards. Still there are 
instances of really poor equipment passing all the appropriate safety 
approvals.

As an aside, in Germany many types of products are subject to TUV testing, 
not just electronics. TUV designs appropriate tests for the product 
category. The bicycle/ski rack on the roof of my car is a TUV approved Thule 
rack, which has mounting systems far superior to their non-approved 
competitor. You can be fairly sure that it won't fly off the car at high 
speeds.

VDE Emissions Testing
---------------------
Germany has different emissions requirements (which are accepted by
most European countries). VDE emissions approval is difficult to
obtain becaues there are only a couple of labs in the United States
that VDE has allowed to certify systems. Thus, few PC's that are not
intended for sale in Europe will have VDE approval.
