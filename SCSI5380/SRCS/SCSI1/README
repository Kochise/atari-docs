This is the mountable MicroForge driver that I mentioned. Several people wanted
it so here it is...

Two notes:
1. It's a generic 4 parallel port SCSI host adapter device driver. Those of you
with a yen to hack TTL gates could cook up an interface for $20 - $30 to use
with this driver.
2. It includes notes on making a DF1: partition for use with DiskCopy...

If Motorola had wanted us to use BPTR's they'd have built in shifts on A regs
[ BCPL? Just say *NO*! ] (I don't smoke, send flames to /dev/null)
