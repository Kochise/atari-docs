Subject: re the 7 scsiDoc files

From: coffin@ROCKY2.ROCKEFELLER.EDU


Part1 (58K): sections 0,1,3, and 4 of full doc.NOTE: NO part(ie, section)#2
  is included. fter unzipping the orig WordStar stuff, I got a very small
  (512 byte) binary file as section 2--apparently a GIF file(for which
  I had no conversion program). In any event, sec. 2 is < 1 page, judging
  from the Table of Contents in section 0.
Part2 (77K): sections 5 and 6.
Part3 (66K): sec. 7.
Part4 (110K): sec 8.
Part5 (69K): sec. 9.
Part6 (84K): sections 10 through 14.
Part7 (46K): appendices A through G, plus an odd glossary-listing type of
   file(apparently needed when using IBM-world programs to view the SCSI
   documentation.
