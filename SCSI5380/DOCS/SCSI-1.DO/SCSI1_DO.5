==============================================================================

  The READ command (Table 9-5) transfers one or more block(s) to the initiator 
beginning with the next block on the logical unit.  The fixed bit specifies 
both the meaning of the transfer length field and whether fixed-length or 
variable-length block(s) are to be transferred.

  If the fixed bit is zero, a single block shall be transferred with the 
transfer length specifying the maximum number of bytes the initiator has 
allocated for the returned data.  If the actual block length is different from 
the specified transfer length, a CHECK CONDITION status shall be sent to the 
initiator and the incorrect length indicator (ILI) bit and valid bit in 
extended sense shall be set to one.  The information bytes in extended sense 
shall be set to the difference (residue) between the requested transfer length 
and the actual block length.  Targets that do not support negative residues 
shall set the ILI bit to one and the residue to zero when the actual block 
length is larger than the transfer length.  In any case, no more than transfer 
length bytes shall be transferred to the initiator and the medium shall be 
positioned after the block (end-of-medium side).

  If the fixed bit is one, the transfer length specifies the number of blocks 
to be transferred to the initiator.  This form of the READ command is valid 
only if the logical unit is currently operating in fixed block mode.  A 
logical unit is in fixed block mode when either of the following conditions 
are true:

  (1) The logical unit reports the same value for minimum block length and 
maximum block length in response to the READ BLOCK LIMITS command.  In this 
case, the current block length is the value returned.

  (2) The logical unit unit has been instructed to use fixed-length blocks 
with the MODE SELECT command.  In this case, the current block length is the 

block length defined in the MODE SELECT command.

  Otherwise, the logical unit is in variable block mode.  The target may 
implement fixed block mode, variable block mode, or both modes.  If the fixed 
bit does not match the current mode, or the mode indicated by the fixed bit is 
not implemented, the target shall reject the command by returning a CHECK 
CONDITION status and by setting the sense key to ILLEGAL REQUEST.

  A successful READ command with the fixed bit equal to one shall transfer the 
current block length times the transfer length bytes of data to the initiator.  
Upon termination of the READ command, the medium shall be positioned after the 
last block transferred (end-of-medium side).

  If the fixed bit is one and if a block is read that is larger or smaller 
than the current block length, a CHECK CONDITION status shall be returned to 
the initiator.  The ILI bit and the valid bit in extended sense shall be set 
to one.  The information bytes shall be set to the difference (residue) 
between the requested transfer length and the actual number of blocks read 
(not including the incorrect length block).  Upon termination, the medium 
shall be positioned after the incorrect length block (end-of-medium side). 

  If a logical unit reads a filemark during a READ command, it shall send a 
CHECK CONDITION status to the initiator and shall set the filemark bit in 
extended sense.  Upon termination, the medium shall be positioned after the 
filemark (end-of-medium side).  If the fixed bit is one, the target shall set 
the valid bit to one and the information bytes shall be set to the difference 
(residue) between the requested transfer length and the actual number of 
blocks read (not including the filemark).

  If a logical unit encounters the physical end-of-medium during a READ 
command, the target shall return a CHECK CONDITION status to the initiator and 
shall set the end-of-medium (EOM) bit to one in extended sense.  The sense key 
shall be set to MEDIUM ERROR.  If the fixed bit is one, the target shall set 
the valid bit to one and the information bytes to the difference (residue) 
between the requested transfer length and the actual number of blocks 
successfully read.  The medium position following this condition is not 
defined. 

  When the transfer length is zero, no data shall be transferred and the 
current position on the logical unit shall not be changed.  This condition 
shall not be considered as an error.

==============================================================================

  The WRITE command (Table 9-6) transfers one or more block(s) from the 
initiator to the current position on the logical unit.  The fixed bit 
specifies both the meaning of the transfer length field and whether fixed-
length or variable-length block(s) are to be transferred.

  If the fixed bit is zero, a single block shall be transferred from the 
initiator and shall be written to the logical unit beginning at the current 
medium position.  The transfer length specifies the length of the block to be 
written (in bytes).  The requested block length shall be within the minimum 
and maximum block length range (returned by the READ BLOCK LIMITS command, 
Section 9.2).  If this condition is not met, a CHECK CONDITION status  shall 
be returned and the sense key shall be set to ILLEGAL REQUEST and no data 
shall be written.  Upon successful termination, the medium shall be positioned 
after the block written by this command (end-of-medium side).

  If the fixed bit is one, the transfer length field specifies the number of 
block(s) to be transferred to the logical unit beginning at the current medium 
position.  This form of the WRITE command is valid only if the logical unit is 
currently operating in fixed block mode (see 9.3).  Upon termination, the 
medium shall be positioned after the block(s) written by this command (end-of-
medium side)

  The target may implement fixed block mode, variable block mode, or both 
modes.  If the fixed bit does not match the current mode, or the mode 
indicated by the fixed bit is not implemented, the target shall reject the 
command by returning a CHECK CONDITION status and by setting the sense key to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST.

  If the early warning end-of-medium condition is encountered while writing, 
an attempt to finish writing any buffered data may be made.  The command shall 

terminate with a CHECK CONDITION status and the EOM bit in extended sense 
shall be set to one.  If any data remains in the target's buffer, then the 
sense key shall be set to VOLUME OVERFLOW.  If the fixed bit is one and the 
logical unit is not buffered (buffered mode of the MODE SENSE command is 
zero), then the valid bit in extended sense shall be set to one and the 
information bytes shall be set to the difference (residue) between the 
requested transfer length and the actual number of blocks written to the 
medium.  If the fixed bit is one and the logical unit is buffered (buffered 
mode of the MODE SENSE command is one), then the valid bit shall be set to one 
and the information bytes shall be set to the total number of blocks not 
written (the number of blocks not transferred from the initiator plus the 
number of blocks remaining in the target's buffer).  Note that in this case it 
is possible for the value in the information bytes to exceed the transfer 
length.

  When the transfer length is zero, no data shall be transferred and the 
current position on the logical unit shall not be changed.  This condition 
shall not be considered as an error.

  The READ REVERSE command (Table 9-8) functions identically to the READ 
command except that medium motion is in the reverse direction.  Thus, the 
block(s) and bytes within the block(s) are transferred in the reverse order 
and the medium position upon termination is before the last block read 
(beginning-of-medium side).  This command shall terminate with a CHECK 
CONDITION status and the EOM bit in extended sense shall be set to one if 
beginning-of-medium or load-point is encountered.  The sense key shall be set 
to NO SENSE.  If the fixed bit is one, then the valid bit shall be set to one 
and the information bytes shall contain the difference (residue) of the 
requested transfer length and the actual number of blocks transferred before 
beginning-of-medium or load-point was encountered.

  Filemark handling is the same as in the READ command except that the medium 
position upon command termination shall be before the filemark (beginning-of-
medium side).

  If the transfer length is zero, no data shall be transferred and the current 
position on the logical unit shall not be changed.  This condition shall not 
be considered as an error.

  The target may implement fixed block mode, variable block mode, or both 
modes.  If the fixed bit does not match the current mode, or the mode 
indicated by the fixed bit is not implemented, the target shall reject the 
command by returning a CHECK CONDITION status and by setting the sense key to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST.

==============================================================================

  The WRITE FILEMARKS command (Table 9-9) causes the specified number of 
filemarks to be written beginning at the current medium position on the 
logical unit.  A zero in this field indicates that no filemarks are to be 
written.

  This command is also used to force any buffered data (see buffered mode in 
the MODE SENSE command, Section 9.14) to be written.  This command shall not 
return a GOOD status unless all buffered data blocks and the filemarks (if 
any) are correctly written on the medium.

  If the early warning end-of-medium condition is encountered while writing, 
an attempt to finish writing any buffered data may be made.  The command shall 
terminate with a CHECK CONDITION status and the EOM bit in extended sense 
shall be set to one.  If any filemarks remain to be written, then the sense 
key shall be set to VOLUME OVERFLOW.  If the logical unit is not buffered 
(buffered mode of the MODE SENSE command is zero), then the valid bit in 
extended sense shall be set to one and the information bytes shall be set to 
the number of unwritten filemarks.  If the logical unit is buffered (buffered 
mode of the MODE SENSE command is one), then the valid bit shall be set to one 
and the information bytes shall be set to the total number of blocks not 
written (the number of unwritten filemarks plus the number of blocks remaining 
in the target's buffer).  Note that in this case it is possible for the value 
in the information bytes to exceed the transfer length.

==============================================================================

  The SPACE command (Table 9-10) provides a variety of positioning functions 
that are determined by the code and count.  Both forward (toward end-of-
medium) and reverse (toward beginning-of-medium) positioning are provided, 
although some SCSI devices may only support a subset of this command.  Such 
SCSI devices shall return a CHECK CONDITION status and set the sense key to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST in response to any attempt to invoke a function that is not 
supported.

  The code is defined as follows:

DB(1)  DB(0)       Description
-----  -----   --------------------
  0      0     Blocks
  0      1     Filemarks
  1      0     Sequential Filemarks
  1      1     Physical End-of-Data

  When spacing over blocks or filemarks, the count field specifies the number 
of blocks or filemarks to be spaced over.  A positive value N in the count 
field shall cause forward medium movement over N blocks or filemarks ending on 
the end-of-medium side of the last block or filemark.  A zero value in the 
count field shall cause no medium movement.  A negative value -N (2's 
complement notation) in the count field shall cause reverse medium movement 
over N blocks or filemarks ending on the beginning-of-medium side of the last 
block or filemark.

  If a filemark is encountered while spacing over blocks, medium movement 
shall be stopped.  The medium shall be positioned on the end-of-medium side of 
the filemark if movement was in the forward direction and on the beginning-of-
medium side of the filemark if movement was in the reverse direction.  A CHECK 

CONDITION status shall be sent to the initiator and the filemark and valid 
bits in extended sense shall be set to one.  The information bytes shall be 
set to the difference (residue) in the requested count and the actual number 
of blocks spaced over (not including the filemark).

  If the physical end-of-medium is encountered while spacing forward over 
blocks or filemarks, the target shall return a CHECK CONDITION status to the 
initiator and shall set the end-of-medium (EOM) bit in extended sense to one.  
The sense key shall be set to MEDIUM ERROR.  The target shall set the valid 
bit to one and the information bytes to the difference (residue) between the 
requested count and the actual number of blocks or filemarks spaced over.

  If beginning-of-medium or load-point is encountered while spacing over 
blocks or filemarks in the reverse direction, the target shall return a CHECK 
CONDITION status to the initiator and shall set the end-of-medium (EOM) bit in 
extended sense to one.  The sense key shall be set to NO SENSE.  The target 
shall set the valid bit to one and the information bytes to the difference 
(residue) between the requested count and the actual number of blocks or 
filemarks spaced over.

  When spacing over sequential filemarks, the count field is interpreted as 
follows:

  (1) A positive value N shall cause forward medium movement to the first 
occurrence of N or more consecutive filemarks stopping after the N th  filemark.

  (2) A zero value shall cause no medium movement.

  (3) A negative value -N (2's complement notation) shall cause reverse medium 
movement to the first occurrence of N or more consecutive filemarks stopping 
on the beginning-of-medium side of the N th  filemark.

  When spacing to physical end-of-data, the count field is ignored.  Forward 
medium movement shall occur until the logical unit encounters physical end-of-
data as defined by the sequential-access device.  Some sequential-access 
devices  define physical end-of-data as an erased area on the medium; however, 
other definitions are not precluded.  Targets that implement this function 
shall leave the medium positioned such that a subsequent WRITE command would 
append data to the last recorded information on the medium.

==============================================================================

  The VERIFY command (Table 9-11) verifies one or more block(s) beginning with 
the next block on the logical unit.  The fixed bit specifies both the meaning 
of the verification length field and whether fixed-length or variable-length 
block(s) are to be verified.

  A byte compare (BytCmp) bit of zero indicates that the verification shall be 
simply a medium verification (CRC, ECC, etc).  No data shall be transferred 
between the initiator and target.  A byte compare bit of one indicates that a 
byte-by-byte compare of the data on the medium, and the data transferred from 
the initiator shall be performed by the target.  Data shall be transferred 
>From the initiator to the target as in a WRITE command.

  A fixed bit of zero requests that the next block of the logical unit be 
verified.  The verification length specifies the number of bytes to verify.  A 
fixed bit of one requests verification length blocks be verified beginning 
with the next logical block on the logical unit.  This form of the VERIFY 
command is only valid if the logical unit is currently in fixed block mode as 
defined in the READ command.  If the data does not compare (byte compare bit 
equals one), the command shall terminate with a CHECK CONDITION status and the 
sense key shall be set to MISCOMPARE.  If the fixed bit is one, the valid bit 
shall be set to one and the information bytes shall be set to the difference 
(residue) between the verification length and the actual number of blocks 
successfully verified.  The medium shall be positioned after the block 
containing the miscompare (end-of-medium side).

  The target may implement fixed block mode, variable block mode, or both 
modes.  If the fixed bit does not match the current mode, or the mode 
indicated by the fixed bit is not implemented, the target shall reject the 
command by returning a CHECK CONDITION status and by setting the sense key to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST.


  The VERIFY command shall terminate when the verification length has been 
satisfied, when a filemark is encountered, or when physical end-of-medium is 
encountered.  The status and sense data for each of these conditions are 
handled the same as in the READ command.  Upon completion of the VERIFY 
command, the medium shall be positioned after the last block from which data 
was verified or after the filemark, if encountered. 

  When the verification length is zero, no data shall be verified and the 
current position on the logical unit shall not be changed.  This condition 
shall not be considered as an error.

==============================================================================

  The RECOVER BUFFERED DATA command (Table 9-12) is used to read data that has 
been transferred to an SCSI device buffer but has not been written on the 
medium.  It is normally only used to recover from error or exception 
conditions that make it impossible to write the buffered data on the medium.

  This command functions similarly to the READ command except that the data is 
transferred from the SCSI device buffer instead of the medium.  The order in 
which block(s) are transferred is the same as if they would have been 
transferred to the medium.  One or more RECOVER BUFFERED DATA commands may be 
used to read the unwritten buffered data.

  The target may implement fixed block mode, variable block mode, or both 
modes.  If the fixed bit does not match the current mode, or the mode 
indicated by the fixed bit is not implemented, the target shall reject the 
command by returning a CHECK CONDITION status and by setting the sense key to 
ILLEGAL REQUEST.

  If an attempt is made to recover more logical blocks of data than are 

contained in the SCSI device buffer, the command shall be terminated with a 
CHECK CONDITION status.  The EOM bit in extended sense shall be set to one.  
If the fixed bit is one, the valid bit shall be set to one and the information 
bytes shall be set to the difference (residue) between the requested transfer 
length and the actual number of blocks transferred.

  The transfer length specifies the number of contiguous logical blocks of 
data to be transferred.  A transfer length of zero indicates that no data 
shall be transferred.  This condition shall not be considered as an error.

  The MODE SELECT command (Table 9-13) provides a means for the initiator to 
specify medium, logical unit, or peripheral device parameters to the target.

  The  parameter list length specifies the length in bytes of the MODE SELECT 
parameter list that shall be transferred during the DATA OUT phase.  A zero 
parameter list length indicates that no data shall be transferred.  This 
condition shall not be considered as an error.

  The MODE SELECT parameter list shown in Table 9-14 contains a four-byte 
header, followed by zero or more eight-byte block descriptors, followed by the 
vendor unique parameters, if any.

  A buffered mode of zero indicates that the target shall not report a GOOD 
status on WRITE commands until the data blocks are actually written on the 
medium.  A buffered mode of one indicates that the target may report a GOOD 
status on WRITE commands as soon as the data block has been transferred to the 
SCSI device buffer.  One or more blocks may be buffered prior to writing the 
block(s) to the medium.  Buffered modes of 2 H  through 7 H  are reserved.

  Code values for the speed field shall be assigned as follows:

   0 H          Default (Use the  peripheral device's default speed).
   1 H          Use the peripheral device's lowest speed.
   2 H   _  F H     Use increasing peripheral device speeds.

  The block descriptor length specifies the length in bytes of all the block 
descriptors.  It is equal to the number of block descriptors times eight and 
does not include the vendor unique parameters, if any.  A block descriptor 
length of zero indicates that no block descriptors are included in the 

parameter list.  This condition shall not be considered as an error.

  Each block descriptor specifies the medium characteristics for all or part 
of a logical unit.  Each block descriptor contains a density code, a number of 
blocks, and a block length.

  Code values for the density code field are defined in Table 9-14.1.

  The number of blocks field specifies the number of logical blocks on the 
medium that meet the density code and block length in the block descriptor.  A 

number of blocks of zero indicates that all of the remaining logical blocks of 
the logical unit shall have the medium characteristics specified by the block 
descriptor.

  The block length specifies the length in bytes of each logical block 
described by the block descriptor.  A block length of zero indicates that the 
length shall be variable.

==============================================================================

  The RESERVE UNIT and RELEASE UNIT commands both use the command descriptor 
block shown in Table 9-15.

   9.12.1 RESERVE UNIT Command.   The RESERVE UNIT command (Table 9-15, 
operation code 16 H ) shall reserve the specified logical unit for the exclusive 
use by the requesting initiator or, if third-party reservation option is 
implemented, to another specified SCSI device.

  The reservation shall remain in effect until superceded by another RESERVE 
UNIT command from the initiator that made the reservation or until released by 
a RELEASE UNIT command from the same initiator, or a BUS DEVICE RESET message 
>From any initiator, or a "hard" RESET condition.  The occurrence of the last 
two conditions is indicated by a sense key of UNIT ATTENTION on the next 
command following the condition.  It is not an error to issue this command to 
a logical unit that is currently reserved to the requesting initiator.

  If the logical unit is previously reserved by another initiator, then the 
target shall either:

  (1)  return a RESERVATION CONFLICT status

  (2)  queue the reservation request and disconnect until all previously 
queued reservations have been released.  When the logical unit is available, 
the target shall reconnect to perform the reservation

  If, after honoring the reservation, any other initiator then subsequently 
attempts to perform any command on the reserved logical unit other than a 
RESERVE UNIT command, which may be queued, or a RELEASE UNIT command, which 
shall be ignored, then the command shall be rejected with a RESERVATION 
CONFLICT status. 

.pn 133
.fo Section 9                            #

  The third-party reservation option for the RESERVE UNIT command allows an 
initiator to reserve a logical unit for another SCSI device.  This option is 
intended for use in multiple-initiator systems that use the COPY command.  Any 
target that implements the third-party reservation option shall also implement 
the third-party release option (see 9.12.2).

  If the third-party (3rdPty) bit is zero, then the third-party reservation 
option is not requested.  If the 3rdPty bit is one and the third-party 
reservation option is implemented, then the RESERVE UNIT command shall reserve 
the specified logical unit for the SCSI device specified in the third-party 
device ID field.  The target shall preserve the reservation until superceded 
by another RESERVE UNIT command from the initiator that made the reservation 
or until released by the same initiator, by a BUS DEVICE RESET message from 
any initiator, or by a "hard" RESET condition.  The target shall ignore (i.e., 
return GOOD status) any attempt made by any other initiator to release the 
reservation.

  If the 3rdPty bit is one and the third-party reservation option is not 
implemented, then the target shall reject the RESERVE UNIT command with a 
CHECK CONDITION status and a sense key of ILLEGAL REQUEST. 

  An initiator that holds a current reservation may modify that reservation 
(e.g., switch third-parties) by issuing another RESERVE UNIT command to the 
same logical unit.  The superceding RESERVE UNIT command shall release the 
previous reservation state only when the new reservation is granted.  A 
superceding reservation takes priority over any previously queued reservation 
request.

   9.12.2 RELEASE UNIT Command.   The RELEASE UNIT command (Table 9-15, 
operation code 17 H ) shall release the logical unit if it is currently reserved 
by the requesting initiator. 

  It is not an error to attempt to release a logical unit that is not 
currently reserved to the requesting initiator.  However, it shall not be 
released if it is reserved by another initiator.

  The third-party release option for the RELEASE UNIT command allows an 
initiator to release a logical unit that was previously reserved using the 
third-party reservation option (see 9.12.1).  This option shall be implemented 
if the third-party reservation option is implemented.  This option is intended 
for use in multiple-initiator systems that use the COPY command.

  If the third-party (3rdPty) bit is zero, then the third-party release option 
is not requested.  If the 3rdPty bit is one and the target implements the 
third-party release option, then the target shall release the specified 
logical unit, but only if the reservation was made using the third-party 
reservation option by the initiator that is requesting the release and for the 
same SCSI device as specified in the third-party device ID field.

  If the 3rdPty bit is one and the target does not implement the third-party 
release option, then the target shall terminate the command with a CHECK 
CONDITION status and the sense key shall be set to ILLEGAL REQUEST.

==============================================================================

  The ERASE command (Table 9-16) causes part or all of the remaining medium to 
be erased beginning from the current medium position.  As used here, "erased" 
means either the medium shall be erased or a pattern shall be written on the 
medium that appears as gap to the target.

  The distance to be erased is controlled by the long bit.  A long bit of one 
indicates that all remaining medium on the logical unit shall be erased.  A 
long bit of zero indicates that a peripheral device specified portion of the 
medium shall be erased.  Normally, short erases are used to create an extended 
gap for software controlled error recovery or for support of "update in place" 
functions.  The medium position following an ERASE command with a long bit of 
one is not defined by this standard.

NOTE:  Some targets may reject ERASE commands with the long bit set to one if 
the medium is not positioned at the beginning-of-medium.

  The MODE SENSE command (Table 9-17) provides a means for a target to report 
its medium, logical unit, or peripheral device parameters to the initiator.  
It is a complementary command to the MODE SELECT command (see 9.11) for 
support of a medium that may contain different densities, such as half-inch 
tapes.

  The allocation length specifies the number of bytes that the initiator has 
allocated for returned MODE SENSE data.  An allocation length of zero 
indicates that no MODE SENSE data shall be transferred.  This condition shall 
not be considered as an error.  Any other value indicates the maximum number 
of bytes that shall be transferred.  The target shall terminate the DATA IN 
phase when allocation length bytes have been transferred or when all available 
MODE SENSE data have been transferred to the initiator, whichever is less.

  The MODE SENSE data (Table 9-18) contains a four-byte header, followed by 
zero or more eight-byte block descriptors, followed by the vendor unique 
parameters, if any.

  The sense data length specifies the length in bytes of the following mode 
sense data that is available to be transferred during the DATA IN phase.  The 
sense data length does not include itself.

  Code values for the medium type field shall be assigned as follows:

   00 H         Default (Only one medium type supported)
   01 H   _  7F H   Reserved
   80 H   _  FF H   Vendor unique

  A write protected (WP) bit of zero indicates that the medium is write 
enabled.  A write protected bit of one indicates that the medium is write 
protected.

  A buffered mode of zero indicates that the target does not report a GOOD 
status on WRITE commands until the data blocks are actually written on the 
medium.  A buffered mode of one indicates that the target may report a GOOD 

status on WRITE commands as soon as the data block has been transferred to the 
SCSI device buffer.  One or more blocks may be buffered prior to writing the 
block(s) to the medium.  Buffered modes of 2 H  through 7 H  are reserved.

  Code values for the speed field shall be assigned as follows:

   0 H          Default (only one speed supported)
   1 H          Lowest peripheral device speed
   2 H   _  F H     Increasing peripheral device speeds

  The block descriptor length specifies the length in bytes of all the block 
descriptors.  It is equal to the number of block descriptors times eight and 
does not include the vendor unique parameters, if any.  A block descriptor 
length of zero indicates that no block descriptors shall be included in the 
parameter list.  This condition shall not be considered as an error.

  Each block descriptor specifies the medium characteristics for all or part 
of a logical unit.  Each block descriptor contains a density code, a number of 
blocks, and a block length.

  Code values for the density code field are defined in Table 9-14.1.

  The number of blocks field specifies the number of logical blocks on the 
medium that meet the density code and block length in the block descriptor.  A 
number of blocks of zero indicates that all of the remaining logical blocks of 
the logical unit have the medium characteristics specified by the block 
descriptor.

  The block length specifies the length in bytes of each logical block 
described by the block descriptor.  A block length of zero indicates that the 
length is variable.

  The LOAD/UNLOAD command (Table 9-19) requests that the target enable or 
disable the logical unit for further operations.  This command may also be 
used to request the re-tension function on peripheral devices that support 
this function.

  A load bit of one indicates that the medium on the logical unit shall be 
loaded and positioned to the beginning-of-medium or load-point as determined 
by the peripheral device.  A load bit of zero indicates that the medium on the 
logical unit shall be positioned for removal from the peripheral device.

  Status shall be returned after the medium is positioned unless the immediate 
(Immed) bit is one.  If the Immed bit is one, status may be returned as soon 
as the command has been accepted.

  A re-tension (Re-Ten) bit of one indicates that the medium on the addressed 
logical unit shall be correctly tensioned before the LOAD/UNLOAD command is 
completed.  This is an optional function intended for use by those peripheral 
devices that support the re-tension function.

==============================================================================

  The PREVENT/ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command (Table 9-20) requests that the 
target enable or disable the removal of the medium in the logical unit.

  A prevent bit of one shall inhibit mechanisms that normally allow removal of 
the medium.  A prevent bit of zero shall allow removal of the medium.

  This prevention of medium removal condition shall terminate upon receipt of 
a PREVENT/ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL command with the prevent bit set to zero, or by 
the receipt of a BUS DEVICE RESET message from any initiator or by a "hard" 
RESET condition.
