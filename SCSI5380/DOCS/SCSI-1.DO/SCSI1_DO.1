Abstract:  This standard defines mechanical, electrical, and functional 
requirements for attaching small computers with each other and with low- to 
medium-performance intelligent peripherals such as rigid disks, flexible 
disks, magnetic tape devices, printers, and optical disks.  The resulting 
interface facilitates the interconnection of small computers and intelligent 
peripherals and thus provides a common interface specification for both 
systems integrators and suppliers of intelligent peripherals.

                                   FOREWORD
    (This Foreword is not part of American National Standard X3.131-198_.)

The development of comparatively inexpensive VLSI device controllers have 
recently changed the economics of interfaces for small system storage devices. 
Where expensive controller logic was once shared among as many devices as 
possible, in many cases it now makes economic sense to build a controller in 
each device.  This is particularly true for high-performance storage devices, 
where the intimate interactions of the recording medium, the recording 
mechanism, and the recording code cause intersymbol interference and error 
recovery problems that are highly specific to the chosen technologies, and are 
best resolved within the device itself.  

Moreover, the number of types of storage devices for small computers, and the 
industry that builds them, have grown dramatically in the past few years.  In 
particular, the emergence of physically small, but comparatively high-capacity 
and high-performance fixed-medium magnetic disk devices (virtually non-
existent in the late 1970s, but a multibillion dollar business in the mid-
1980s) has driven the development of small computer systems and caused a need 
for other classes of devices, such as streaming cartridge tape drives, for 
backup and data interchange.

Because device interfaces are very specific to device types, many device level 
interface standards would be required to service all small computer device 
types.  Because backplane buses reside at the center of computers, and have 
dramatic performance effects, many different ones are needed for different 
system requirements.  To connect every backplane bus to every device interface 
through a controller would require an almost unbounded number of specific 
controller products.  

In addition, in many systems today, it is not the computer which is "central", 
it is the storage facility.  That is, one or two large capacity storage 
subsystems serve several computers.  An interface adapted to this reality was 
needed.  

By 1982, all the needs given above were widely recognized in the industry and 
by the members of X3T9 and its Task Groups.  A commercial small system 
parallel bus, the Shugart Associates System Interface (SASI), generally met 
the small system requirements for a device-independent peripheral or system 
bus and had enjoyed significant market success.  It was offered to X3T9.2 as 
the basis for a standard.  X3T9.2 chose the name Small Computer System 
Interface (SCSI) for that standard and began work at its April 1982 meeting.  
The present SCSI dpANS is a formalization and extension of the SASI.  Many 
existing SASI devices are SCSI compatible.

Since April 1982, X3T9.2 has held plenary sessions, at two month intervals, 
plus numerous informal working meetings.  The original SASI has been extended 
in a number of ways, including:

  (1)  A differential electrical option has been added to allow use of longer 
cables (up to 25 meters) in environments where common mode noise is a concern.

  (2)  A synchronous transfer option has been developed allowing maximum 
transfer rates in the 3 to 4 megabyte per second range.

  (3)  An optional "extended" command set has been added, allowing for very 

large capacity storage devices (a block address space of 2 32  blocks versus 2 21  
for SASI), and Inquiry commands that allow self-configuring driver software. 

  (4)  Command sets for magnetic tape (both start/stop and streaming), 
printers, processors, optical disks, and read-only optical disks have been 
added to the proposed SCSI standard, in addition to those for magnetic disks.  

Although it might have been premature in April 1982 to claim that SASI was 
then a  de facto  standard, this surely is the case for SASI/SCSI today.  SCSI 
compatible host adapters, controllers, and peripheral devices are now widely 
manufactured around the world.  Host adapters are available for most small 
computers with accessible backplane buses.  SCSI controllers are widely 
available for all the  de jure  and  de facto  standard magnetic disk and magnetic 
tape device interfaces.  Small high-capacity fixed-medium magnetic disks, 
rigid removable-medium magnetic disks, high-capacity Bernoulli-effect flexible 
disks, and other closed-loop high-capacity flexible disk products, as well as 
optical disk products, are all available with integral SCSI controllers.  SCSI 
subsystems that integrate both a rigid-disk and a streaming-tape drive into a 
single package are also available.  SCSI interface chips are available, and 
some disk controller chip sets also provide SCSI support.

Since a large number of companies have implemented and tested the SCSI during 
the development of the proposed standard, no separate test program has been 
deemed necessary.  At the February 1984 meeting of X3T9.2, representatives of 
the following companies stated, for the record, that their companies had 
implemented and tested SCSI:  Adaptec, Adaptive Data, Data Technology Corp., 
Fujitsu America, Inc., NCR Corp., and Shugart Corp.  This is not a complete 
list of companies implementing products using SCSI nor is it a promise by 
these companies to offer SCSI products.  

The SCSI fills an urgent need, provides for the future, and is consonant with 
actual commercial practice.  Most important, the timing is right.  SCSI 
catches the floodtide of new, high-performance storage devices for small 
systems, and promises to bring a measure of needed order to what would 
otherwise be a chaotic and fragmented market.  

This standard specifies the mechanical, electrical, and functional 
requirements for a small computer input/output bus interface, and command sets 
for peripheral device types, particularly storage devices, commonly used with 
small computers.

Suggestions for improvement of this standard will be welcome.  They should be 
sent to the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, 311 
First Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20001.

This standard was processed and approved for submittal to ANSI by American 
National Standards Committee on Computers and Information Processing, X3.

 1. Scope 

This American National Standard provides the mechanical, electrical, and 
functional requirements for a small computer input/output bus and command sets 
for peripheral device types commonly used with small computers.

  The small computer system interface, described in this standard, is a local 
I/O bus that can be operated at data rates up to 4 megabytes per second 
depending upon circuit implementation choices.  The primary objective of the 
interface is to provide host computers with device independence within a 
class of devices.  Thus, different disk drives, tape drives, printers, and 
even communication devices can be added to the host computer(s) without 
requiring modifications to generic system hardware or software.  Provision 
is made for the addition of nongeneric features and functions through vendor 
unique fields and codes.

  The interface uses logical rather than physical addressing for all data 
blocks.  For direct access devices, each logical unit may be interrogated to 
determine how many blocks it contains.  A logical unit may coincide with all 
or part of a peripheral device.

  Provision is made for cable lengths up to 25 meters using differential 
drivers and receivers.  A single-ended driver and receiver configuration is 
defined for cable lengths of up to 6 meters and is primarily intended for 
applications within a cabinet.

  The interface protocol includes provision for the connection of multiple 
initiators (SCSI devices capable of initiating an operation) and multiple 
targets (SCSI devices capable of responding to a request to perform an 
operation).  Optional distributed arbitration (i.e., bus-contention logic) is 
built into the architecture of SCSI.  A priority system awards interface 
control to the highest priority SCSI device that is contending for use of the 
bus.  The time to complete arbitration is independent of the number of devices 
that are contending and can be completed in less than 10 microseconds.

  The physical characteristics are described in Section 4.  There are two 
electrical alternatives: single-ended and differential.  Single-ended and 
differential devices are electrically different and shall not be mixed on the 
same bus.  In addition, there are several options: shielded or unshielded 
connectors may be used and parity may or may not be implemented.

  Section 5 describes the logical characteristics of the interface.  An 
arbitration option is defined to permit multiple initiators and to permit 
concurrent I/O operations.  All SCSI devices are required to be capable of 
operating with the defined asynchronous transfer protocol.  In addition, an 
optional synchronous transfer protocol is defined.  Section 5 also specifies a 
message protocol for control of the interface.  In most cases, messages are 
not directly apparent to the host computer software.  Only one message, 
COMMAND COMPLETE, is mandatory; all others are optional and are not 
necessarily implemented.  Note that some options (e.g., synchronous transfer) 
require the implementation of certain messages.

  The SCSI command structure is specified in Section 6.  Commands are 
classified as mandatory (M), extended (E), optional (O), or vendor unique (V).  
SCSI devices shall implement all mandatory commands defined for the 
appropriate device type and may implement other commands as well.  Extended 

SCSI devices shall implement all extended plus all mandatory commands and may 
implement other commands as well.  Extended SCSI devices contain commands that 
facilitate the writing of self-configuring software drivers that can 
"discover" all necessary attributes without prior knowledge of specific 
peripheral characteristics (such as storage capacity).  Extended commands for 
direct access devices also implement a very large logical block address space 
(2 32  blocks), although mandatory commands for direct access devices implement 
a somewhat smaller logical block address space (2 21  blocks).

  Section 7 specifies those commands that have a consistent meaning for all 
device types.

  Sections 8 through 13 contain commands for direct-access (e.g., magnetic 
disk), sequential-access (e.g., magnetic tape), printer, processor, write-
once-read-multiple (e.g., optical disk), and read-only direct-access devices, 
respectively.  The commands in each of these sections are unique to the device 
type, or they have interpretations, fields, or features that are specific for 
the device type.  Thus, for example, although the WRITE command is used for 
several device types, it has a somewhat different form for each type, with 
different parameters and meanings.  Therefore, it is specified separately for 
each device type.

  Section 14 describes the status byte for all device types.  Status is 
returned by targets at the end of each command.

 4. Physical Characteristics 

This section contains the physical definition of the SCSI.  The connectors, 
cables, signals, terminators, and bus timing needed to implement SCSI are 
covered.

 4.1 Physical Description.   SCSI devices are daisy-chained together using a 
common cable.  Both ends of the cable are terminated.  All signals are common 
between all SCSI devices.  Two driver/receiver alternatives are available:

  (1) Single-ended drivers and receivers, which allow a maximum cable length 
of six meters (primarily for connection within a cabinet)

  (2) Differential drivers and receivers, which allow a maximum cable length 
of 25 meters (primarily for connection outside of a cabinet)

 4.2 Cable Requirements.   An ideal impedance match with cable terminators 
implies a cable characteristic impedance of 132 ohms (singled-ended option) or 
122 ohms (differential option). In general, cables with this high of a 
characteristic impedance are not available; however, impedances that are 
somewhat lower are satisfactory.  A characteristic impedance of 100 ohms  +  10% 
is recommended for unshielded flat or twisted pair ribbon cable.  A 
characteristic impedance greater than 90 ohms is preferred for shielded 
cables; however, most available cables have a somewhat lower characteristic 
impedance.  To minimize discontinuities and signal reflections, cables of 
different impedances should not be used in the same bus.  Implementations may 
require trade-offs in shielding effectiveness, cable length, the number of 
loads, transfer rates, and cost to achieve satisfactory system operation.

  A minimum conductor size of 28 AWG shall be employed to minimize noise 
effects and ensure proper distribution of optional terminator power.
.cp 5
   4.2.1 Single-Ended Cable.   A 50-conductor flat cable or 25-signal twisted-
pair cable shall be used.  The maximum cable length shall be 6.0 meters.

  A stub length of no more than 0.1 meters is allowed off the mainline 
interconnection within any connected equipment.

  SCSI bus termination may be internal to the SCSI devices that are at the 
ends of the cable.

   4.2.2 Differential Cable.   A 50-conductor cable or 25-signal twisted-pair 
cable shall be used.  The maximum cable length shall be 25 meters.

  A stub length of no more than 0.2 meters is allowed off the mainline 
interconnection within any connected equipment.

  SCSI bus termination may be internal to the SCSI devices that are at the 
ends of the cable.

 4.3 Connector Requirements.   Nonshielded connectors are specified.  The 
nonshielded connectors are typically used for in-cabinet applications.  
Appendix D defines recommended shielded connectors and their pin assignments.  
These connectors are typically used for external applications where 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electrostatic discharge (ESD) 
protection may be required.  Either type of connector may be used with the 
single-ended or differential drivers.


  The nonshielded SCSI device connector (Figure 4-1) shall be a 50-conductor 
connector consisting of two rows of 25 male pins with adjacent pins 2.54 mm 
(0.1 in) apart.  A shroud and header body should be used.  The nonmating 
portion of the connector is shown for reference only.

  The nonshielded cable connector (Figure 4-2) shall be a 50-conductor 
connector consisting of two rows of 25 female contacts with adjacent contacts 
2.54 mm (0.1 in) apart.  It is recommended that keyed connectors be used.

  The unshielded connector pin assignments shall be as shown in Table 4-1 for 
single-ended drivers and as shown in Table 4-2 for differential drivers.

 4.4 Electrical Description 

NOTE:  For these measurements, SCSI bus termination is assumed to be external 
to the SCSI device.  An SCSI device may have the provision for allowing 
optional internal termination.

   4.4.1 Single-Ended Alternative.   All assigned signals shall be terminated 
with 220 ohms to +5 volts (nominal) and 330 ohms to ground at each end of the 
cable.  (See Figure 4-5.)  All signals shall use open-collector or three-state 
drivers.

      4.4.1.1 Output Characteristics.   Each signal driven by an SCSI device 
shall have the following output characteristics when measured at the SCSI 
device's connector:

  Signal assertion = 0.0 volts dc to 0.4 volts dc 
  Minimum driver output capability = 48 milliamps (sinking) at 0.5 volts dc
  Signal negation = 2.5 volts dc to 5.25 volts dc

      4.4.1.2 Input Characteristics.   Each signal received by an SCSI device 
shall have the following input characteristics when measured at the SCSI 
device's connector:

  Signal true = 0.0 volts dc to 0.8 volts dc
  Maximum total input load = -0.4 milliamps at 0.4 volts dc
  Signal false = 2.0 volts dc to 5.25 volts dc
  Minimum input hysteresis = 0.2 volts dc

   4.4.2 Differential Alternative.   All signals consist of two lines denoted 
+SIGNAL and -SIGNAL.  A signal is true when +SIGNAL is more positive than 
-SIGNAL, and a signal is false when -SIGNAL is more positive than +SIGNAL.  
All assigned signals shall be terminated at each end of the cable as shown in 
Figure 4-6.

NOTE:  As an option, the DIFFSENS signal of the connector is reserved for an 
active high enable for the differential drivers.  If a single-ended device or 
terminator is inadvertently connected, this signal is grounded, disabling the 
drivers.  (See Figure 4-7.)

      4.4.2.1 Output Characteristics.   Each signal driven by an SCSI device 
shall have the following output characteristics when measured at the SCSI 
device's connector:

   V OL  (Low-level output voltage) = 2.0 V maximum at I OL  (Low-level output 
                                      current) = 55 milliamps.
   V OH  (High-level output voltage) = 3.0 V minimum at I OH  (High-level output 
                                       current) = -55 milliamps.
   V OD  (Differential voltage) = 1.0 V minimum with common-mode voltage ranges 
                                  from -7 volts dc to +12 volts dc.

  V OL  and V OH  shall be as measured between the output terminal and the SCSI 
device's logic ground reference.

  The output characteristics shall additionally conform to EIA RS-485-1983.
.pa

      4.4.2.2 Input Characteristics.   Each signal received by an SCSI device 
shall have the following input characteristics when measured at the SCSI 
device's connector:

  I I  (Input current on either input) =  +  2.0 milliamps maximum.

NOTE:  These characteristics include both receivers and passive drivers.

  This requirement shall be met with the input voltage varying between 
-7 volts dc and +12 volts dc, with power on or off, and with the hysteresis 
equaling 35 millivolts, minimum.

  The input characteristics shall additionally conform to EIA RS-485-1983.

   4.4.3 Terminator Power (Optional).   Single-ended SCSI devices providing 
terminator power (TERMPWR) shall have the following characteristics:

  V Term  =  4.0 volts dc to 5.25 volts dc
           800 milliamps minimum source drive capability
           1.0 milliamp maximum sink capability (except for the purposes of 
             providing power to an internal terminator) with 1.0 amp 
             recommended current limiting (e.g., a fuse).

  Differential SCSI devices providing terminator power (TERMPWR) shall have 
the following characteristics:

  V Term  =  4.0 volts dc to 5.25 volts dc
           600 milliamps minimum source drive capability
           1.0 milliamp maximum sink capability (except for the purposes of 
             providing power to an internal terminator) with 1.0 amp 
             recommended current limiting (e.g., a fuse).

  The use of keyed connectors is recommended in SCSI devices that provide 
terminator power to prevent accidental grounding or misconnection of 
terminator power.

  SCSI devices that supply terminator power shall do so through a diode or 
similar semiconductor that prevents the backflow of power to the SCSI device.

 4.5 SCSI Bus.   Communication on the SCSI bus is allowed between only two SCSI 
devices at any given time.  There is a maximum of eight SCSI devices.  Each 
SCSI device has an SCSI ID bit assigned as shown in Figure 4-8.

  When two SCSI devices communicate on the SCSI bus, one acts as an initiator 
and the other acts as a target.  The initiator originates an operation and the 
target performs the operation.  An SCSI device usually has a fixed role as an 
initiator or target, but some devices may be able to assume either role.

  An initiator may address up to eight peripheral devices that are connected 
to a target.  An option allows the addressing of up to 2,048 peripheral 
devices per target using extended messages.  Three sample system 
configurations are shown in Figure 4-9.

  Up to eight SCSI devices can be supported on the SCSI bus.  They can be any 
combination of initiators and targets.

  Certain SCSI bus functions are assigned to the initiator and certain SCSI 
bus functions are assigned to the target.  The initiator may arbitrate for the 
SCSI bus and select a particular target.  The target may request the transfer 
of COMMAND, DATA, STATUS, or other information on the DATA BUS, and in some 
cases it may arbitrate for the SCSI bus and reselect an initiator for the 
purpose of continuing an operation.

  Information transfers on the DATA BUS are asynchronous and follow a defined 
REQ/ACK handshake protocol.  One byte of information may be transferred with 
each handshake.  An option is defined for synchronous data transfer.

 4.6 SCSI Bus Signals.   There are a total of eighteen signals.  Nine are used 
for control and nine are used for data.  (Data signals include the parity 
signal option).  These signals are described as follows:

 BSY (BUSY).   An "OR-tied" signal that indicates that the bus is being used.

 SEL (SELECT).   A signal used by an initiator to select a target or by a target 
to reselect an initiator.

 C/D  (CONTROL/DATA).   A signal driven by a target that indicates whether 
CONTROL or DATA information is on the DATA BUS.  True indicates CONTROL.

 I/O (INPUT/OUTPUT).   A signal driven by a target that controls the direction 
of data movement on the DATA BUS with respect to an initiator. True indicates 
input to the initiator.  This signal is also used to distinguish between 
SELECTION and RESELECTION phases.

 MSG (MESSAGE).   A signal driven by a target during the MESSAGE phase.

 REQ (REQUEST).   A signal driven by a target to indicate a request for a 
REQ/ACK data transfer handshake.

 ACK (ACKNOWLEDGE).   A signal driven by an initiator to indicate an 
acknowledgment for a REQ/ACK data transfer handshake.

 ATN (ATTENTION).   A signal driven by an initiator to indicate the ATTENTION 
condition.

 RST (RESET).   An "OR-tied" signal that indicates the RESET condition.

 DB(7-0,P) (DATA BUS).   Eight data-bit signals, plus a parity-bit signal that 
form a DATA BUS.   DB(7) is the most significant bit and has the highest 
priority during the ARBITRATION phase.  Bit number, significance, and priority 
decrease downward to DB(0).  A data bit is defined as one when the signal 
value is true and is defined as zero when the signal value is false.

  Data parity DB(P) is odd.  The use of parity is a system option (i.e., a 
system is configured so that all SCSI devices on a bus generate parity and 
have parity detection enabled, or all SCSI devices have parity detection 
disabled or not implemented).  Parity is not valid during the ARBITRATION 
phase.


   4.6.1 Signal Values.   Signals may assume true or false values.  There are 
two methods of driving these signals.  In both cases, the signal shall be 
actively driven true, or asserted. In the case of OR-tied drivers, the driver 
does not drive the signal to the false state, rather the bias circuitry of the 
bus terminators pulls the signal false whenever it is released by the drivers 
at every SCSI device.  If any driver is asserted, then the signal is true.  In 
the case of non-OR-tied drivers, the signal may be actively driven false, or 
negated.  In this standard, wherever the term negated is used, it means that 
the signal may be actively driven false, or may be simply released (in which 
case the bias circuitry pulls it false), at the option of the implementor.  
The advantage to actively drive signals false is that the transition from true 
to false occurs more quickly, and noise margins may be somewhat improved; this 
may permit somewhat faster data transfer. 

   4.6.2 OR-Tied Signals.   The BSY and RST signals shall be OR-tied only.  In 
the ordinary operation of the bus, these signals are simultaneously driven 
true by several drivers.  No signals other than BSY, RST, and DB(P) are 
simultaneously driven by two or more drivers, and any signal other than BSY 
and RST may employ OR-tied or non-OR-tied drivers.  DB(P) shall not be driven 
false during the ARBITRATION phase.  There is no operational problem in mixing 
OR-tied and non-OR-tied drivers on signals other than BSY and RST.

   4.6.3 Signal Sources.   Table 4-3 indicates which type of SCSI device is 
allowed to source each signal.  No attempt is made to show if the source is 
driving asserted, driving negated, or is passive.  All SCSI device drivers 
that are not active sources shall be in the passive state.  Note that the RST 
signal may be sourced by any SCSI device at any time.

All:          The signal shall be driven by all SCSI  devices that are 
              actively arbitrating.

SCSI ID:      A unique data bit (the SCSI ID) shall be driven by each SCSI 
              device that is actively arbitrating; the other seven data bits 
              shall be released (i.e., not driven) by this SCSI device.  The 
              parity bit (DB(P)) may be undriven or driven to the true state, 
              but shall never be driven to the false state during this phase.

I&T:          The signal shall be driven by the initiator, target, or both, as 
              specified in the SELECTION phase and RESELECTION phase.

Initiator:    If this signal is driven, it shall be driven only by the active 
              initiator.

None:         The signal shall be released; that is, not be driven by any SCSI 
              device.  The bias circuitry of the bus terminators pulls the 
              signal to the false state.

Winner:       The signal shall be driven by the one SCSI device that wins 
              arbitration.

Target:       If the signal is driven, it shall be driven only by the active 
              target.

 4.7 SCSI Bus Timing.   Unless otherwise indicated, the delay-time measurements 
for each SCSI device, shown in 4.7.1 through 4.7.14, shall be calculated from 
signal conditions existing at that SCSI device's own SCSI bus connection.  
Thus, these measurements (except cable skew delay) can be made without 
considering delays in the cable.

   4.7.1 Arbitration Delay (2.2 microseconds).   The minimum time an SCSI device 
shall wait from asserting BSY for arbitration until the DATA BUS can be 
examined to see if arbitration has been won.  There is no maximum time.

   4.7.2 Assertion Period (90 nanoseconds).   The minimum time that a target 
shall assert REQ while using synchronous data transfers.  Also, the minimum 
time that an initiator shall assert ACK while using synchronous data 
transfers.

   4.7.3 Bus Clear Delay (800 nanoseconds).   The maximum time for an SCSI 
device to stop driving all bus signals after:

  (1) The BUS FREE phase is detected (BSY and SEL both false for a bus settle 
delay)
  (2) SEL is received from another SCSI device during the ARBITRATION phase
  (3) The transition of RST to true.

NOTE:  For the first condition above, the maximum time for an SCSI device to 
clear the bus is 1200 nanoseconds from BSY and SEL first becoming both false.  
If an SCSI device requires more than a bus settle delay to detect BUS FREE 
phase, it shall clear the bus within a bus clear delay minus the excess time.

   4.7.4 Bus Free Delay (800 nanoseconds).   The minimum time that an SCSI 
device shall wait from its detection of the BUS FREE phase (BSY and SEL both 
false for a bus settle delay) until its assertion of BSY when going to the 
ARBITRATION phase.

   4.7.5 Bus Set Delay (1.8 microseconds).   The maximum time for an SCSI device 
to assert BSY and its SCSI ID bit on the DATA BUS after it detects BUS FREE 
phase (BSY and SEL both false for a bus settle delay) for the purpose of 
entering the ARBITRATION phase.

   4.7.6 Bus Settle Delay (400 nanoseconds).   The time to wait for the bus to 
settle after changing certain control signals as called out in the protocol 
definitions.

   4.7.7 Cable Skew Delay (10 nanoseconds).   The maximum difference in 
propagation time allowed between any two SCSI bus signals when measured 
between any two SCSI devices.

   4.7.8 Data Release Delay (400 nanoseconds).   The maximum time for an 
initiator to release the DATA BUS signals following the transition of the I/O 
signal from false to true.

   4.7.9 Deskew Delay (45 nanoseconds).   The minimum time required for deskew 
of certain signals.

   4.7.10 Hold Time (45 nanoseconds).   The minimum time added between the 
assertion of REQ or ACK and the changing of the data lines to provide hold 
time in the initiator or target, respectively, while using synchronous data 

transfers.

   4.7.11 Negation Period (90 nanoseconds).   The minimum time that a target 
shall negate REQ while using synchronous data transfers.  Also, the minimum 
time that an initiator shall negate ACK while using synchronous data 
transfers.

   4.7.12 Reset Hold Time (25 microseconds).   The minimum time for which RST is 
asserted.  There is no maximum time.

   4.7.13 Selection Abort Time (200 microseconds).   The maximum time that a 
target (or initiator) shall take from its most recent detection of being 
selected (or reselected) until asserting a BSY response.  This timeout is 
required to ensure that a target (or initiator) does not assert BSY after a 
SELECTION (or RESELECTION) phase has been aborted.  This is not the selection 
timeout period; see Sections 5.1.3.5 and 5.1.4.2 for a complete description.

   4.7.14 Selection Timeout Delay (250 milliseconds, recommended).   The minimum 
time that an initiator (or target) should wait for a BSY response during the 
SELECTION (or RESELECTION) phase before starting the timeout procedure.  Note 
that this is only a recommended time period.  The specifications for the 
peripheral devices shall be consulted for the actual timing requirements.

   4.7.15 Transfer Period (set during a MESSAGE phase).   The Transfer Period 
specifies the minimum time allowed between the leading edges of successive REQ 
pulses and of successive ACK pulses while using synchronous data transfers.  
(See Sections 5.1.5.2 and 5.5.5.)
