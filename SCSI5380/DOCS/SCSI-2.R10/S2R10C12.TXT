12. Write-Once Devices

12.1. Model for Write-Once Devices

  The model for the write-once device is a variation on the optical memory 
model.  Most of the aspects of a write-once device are similar to optical 
memory devices.  The differences are summarized below.

12.1.1. Logical Blocks

  Data may be written to a logical block only once.  A subsequent write to a 
logical block already written may or may not be corrupted, depending on the 
implementation.  Write-once physical media is non-volatile.

  The "updating" of blocks (see 15.1) is discouraged.  SCSI write-once devices 
are intended to be "archival" in nature.  Data at a logical block address is 
not expected to change once written.  The "update" commands are not defined 
for this device type.  Devices are not precluded from implementing the 
"update" function by this standard, though devices that require the update 
function should use the optical memory device type.

  Devices may be able to determine the state of a logical block prior to 
access.  These devices can determine whether a block is blank or written. This 
is useful in detecting previously written blocks, preventing a destructive 
overwrite.  This is also useful in finding blank areas for later writing.  The 
MEDIUM SCAN command can be used to find blank and written areas prior to WRITE 
and READ access.

12.1.2. Initialization

  The FORMAT UNIT command is not defined for write-once devices.  Write-once 
media is shipped pre-formatted by the manufacturer and is ready for use when 
mounted.

12.1.3. Physical Medium Defects

  The raw defect rate is typically higher for optical medium than for magnetic 
medium.  Data is usually recovered through the use of sophisticated error 
correction algorithms.  The level of error correction used for data recovery 
is often can be selected.  However, many write-once devices have a minimum 
level that is always used and cannot be de-selected through the error recovery 
mode parameter.  Control of the error correction algorithms and level of 
correction is vendor specific.

  Defect management on write-once devices is usually vendor specific.  However 
there are standards for some types of write-once media that specify defect 
management techniques.  These standards, where they exist, may supersede the 
implementation requirements pertaining to error and defect reporting in this 
standard.






12.1.4. Error Reporting

  If any of the following conditions occur during the execution of a command 
the target shall return CHECK CONDITION status.  The appropriate sense key and 
additional sense code should be set.  The following table illustrates some 
error conditions and the applicable sense keys.  The table does not provide an 
exhaustive enumeration of all conditions that may cause the CHECK CONDITION 
status.

Condition                                         Sense Key
----------------------------------------------    ----------------------------
Invalid logical block address                     ILLEGAL REQUEST

Unsupported option requested                      ILLEGAL REQUEST

Target reset or medium change since
last command from this initiator                  UNIT ATTENTION

Self diagnostic failed                            HARDWARE ERROR

Unrecovered read error                            MEDIUM ERROR
                                                  HARDWARE ERROR

Recovered read error                              RECOVERED ERROR

Overrun or other error that might
be resolved by repeating the command              ABORTED COMMAND

Attempt to write on write protected medium        DATA PROTECT

Attempt to read a blank or previously
unwritten block                                   BLANK CHECK

Attempt to write a previously written 
block and blank checking is enabled               BLANK CHECK


  In the case of an invalid logical block address, the sense data information 
field shall be set to the logical block address of the first invalid address.

  In the case of an attempt to read a blank or previously unwritten block, the 
sense data information field shall be set to the logical block address of the 
first blank block encountered.  The data read up to that block shall be 
transferred.

  In the case of an attempt to write a previously written block and blank 
checking is enabled, the sense information field shall be set to the logical 
block address of the first non-blank block encountered.
