11. Processor Devices

11.1. Model for Processor Devices

  The SCSI processor device is a target with the characteristics of a primary 
computing device, typically a personal computer, minicomputer, mainframe 
computer, or auxiliary computing device or server.  Such a primary computing 
device is often called a host.  The processor device receives or provides 
packets of data as requested by the initiator.  

  In the SCSI processor device, the target accepts and provides the data 
packets transferred according to the commands of the initiator.  The initiator 
and the processor device are both assumed to know the rules by which 
information is exchanged between them, how the information is interpreted by 
the processor device, and when it is allowable to exchange the information.  
These rules are not specified by this standard.

  The initiator requests that the processor device accept a packet of data by 
transmitting a SEND command.  The initiator requests that the processor device 
return a packet of data by transmitting a RECEIVE command.  A COPY command can 
also be transmitted to the processor device to request that it serve as a copy 
manager.  The actual data flow can be between the processor device and another 
SCSI device or can be between two SCSI devices under control of the processor 
device acting as a copy manager.

  If a processor device temporarily has no resource available to manage a data 
packet from the initiator, has no data packet to provide to the initiator, or 
has no resources assigned to perform the operation, the device may then choose 
one of the following responses: 
  1) Terminate the command with CHECK CONDITION status and the sense key NOT 
READY with the appropriate additional sense code for the condition.  This is 
the appropriate response to a TEST UNIT READY command. 
  2) Disconnect until the necessary resource or data packet becomes available, 
and then reconnect to the initiator and resume the operation.
  3) Terminate the command with BUSY status.

  More than one Logical Unit  can be implemented by a processor device.   
Logical Units can serve as additional paths to a single resource, and/or each 
logical unit can serve as a path to different resources within the device.  A 
single logical unit may also serve as a path to multiple resources if the 
processor device can interpret information within the data packet and route 
the packet to the appropriate resource.  If the logical unit addressed by the 
initiator does not have an available resource or data packet associated with 
it, the processor device may choose to treat the logical unit as an invalid 
logical unit (see 6.5.3) or respond as described in the previous paragraph.

  If the processor device determines that an error or unusual condition has 
occurred while performing an operation specified by the contents of a data 
packet, the information describing the condition is normally returned as a 
part of a data packet.  If the processor device determines that an error or 
unusual condition has occurred while executing the SCSI command from the 
initiator, the command is terminated with a CHECK CONDITION and the failures 
are identified through a REQUEST SENSE command.


  The SCSI processor device is distinguished from a SCSI communications device 
by the fact that the primary destination of the data packets is within the 
target device.  A SCSI communications device, in contrast, passes the data on 
to an ultimate destination outside the target through a network.  Many types 
of devices may find it convenient to function as processor devices if no other 
suitable SCSI device type exists and if the packet exchange protocol dictated 
by the processor device model meets their functional requirements.  Devices 
requiring totally incompatible protocols and command sets should be examined 
carefully to be sure that the incompatibilities are based on functional 
requirements.  If  they are, they should be treated as vendor unique device 
types.

  Several examples of processor device implementations are provided to clarify 
the range of utility of the SCSI processor device.

11.1.1. Host to Host Communication, SEND Only

  A host system, (Host A), takes the initiator role and selects a processor 
device (Host B), transmitting a packet to Host B using the SEND command.  The 
SEND command contains an operating system call that requests data from the 
local storage devices attached to Host B.  After performing the functions 
required by the data packet, Host B assumes the initiator mode and selects 
Host A as a processor device and uses a SEND command to transmit the requested 
data back to Host A.  Host A thus acts as a primary computer and Host B as a 
specialized data server computer.  Note that the SEND command is sufficient to 
perform a complete transaction if both Host A and Host B are capable of acting 
as initiators.  This provides the capability of a high bandwidth inter-
communication among nearby host processors.

11.1.2. Host to Host Communication, SEND and RECEIVE

  A host system (Host A) takes the initiator role and selects a processor 
device (Host B), transmitting a packet using the SEND command to Host B 
containing instructions about an operation to be performed.  Host A again 
takes the initiator role and sends the data to be used by Host B in the 
operation.  Host A then assumes that a result will be obtained consistent with 
rules understood by both devices.  Host A generates a RECEIVE command to 
obtain the result from Host B.  If the result is not yet ready, Host B may 
disconnect until the calculation is complete and the requested data packet can 
be returned to Host A.  Note that Host A need not support target mode and Host 
B need not support initiator mode to successfully complete an exchange between 
the two devices.

11.1.3. Host to Special Output Peripheral

  A special co-processor device which can use the processor device command set 
is a high performance graphics display terminal.  The initiator sends control 
and data packets to the display terminal that contain the image to be 
displayed.  Only the SEND command would be required.  A peripheral failure 
would be indicated through the normal CHECK CONDITION / REQUEST SENSE 
protocol. 




11.1.4. Host to Special Input Peripheral

  A second special co-processor device which can use the processor device 
command set is a data acquisition subsystem.  Such subsystems may multiplex 
and compact streams of data from many sources.  A host could control the data 
acquisition modes and the selection of data streams by transmitting control 
packets to the processor device using the SEND command.  The host could then 
obtain the acquired data by executing a series of RECEIVE commands.  The data 
acquisition device could also serve as an initiator, selecting peripheral 
storage devices and storing the compacted acquired data there for later access 
directly by the host or through Host to Host communication protocols.  A 
peripheral failure would be indicated through the normal CHECK CONDITION / 
REQUEST SENSE protocol.

  The SEND command (Table 11-3 requests the target transfer data from the 
initiator.

  An asynchronous event notification (AEN) bit of one indicates that the data 
to be transferred conforms to AEN data format as defined in Table 11-4.  A 
SEND command with an AEN bit of one shall only be issued to logical unit zero.


  An AEN bit of zero indicates that the data to be transferred are vendor-
specific.

  The transfer length specifies the length in bytes of data that shall be sent 
during the DATA OUT phase.  A transfer length of zero indicates that no data 
shall be sent.  This condition shall not be considered as an error.

  A logical unit target (LUNTAR) bit of zero specifies that the asynchronous 
event occurred on a logical unit.  A LUNTAR bit of one specifies that the 
asynchronous event occurred on a target routine.

  If the LUNTAR bit is zero, the logical unit number target routine number 
(LUNTRN) field specifies on which logical unit the asynchronous event 
occurred.  If the LUNTAR bit is one, the LUNTRN field specifies on which 
target routine the asynchronous event occurred.

  The sense data bytes are defined in Table 7-35.
