17. Communications Devices


17.1. Communications Device Model

  A communications device provides a facility to send and receive information 
over some medium (usually an electrical or fiber-optic cable) using a defined 
protocol to one or more other systems which support the same protocol.  The 
media and protocols are often specified in national or international 
standards, although some are proprietary.  Within this section, the protocol 
used on the external medium is called the "external protocol".

  The SCSI communications device model assumes that information to control the 
external protocol is embedded within the data transferred by the SEND and GET 
MESSAGE commands.  The structure of the data transferred by these commands is 
not defined by this standard.  Vendor-unique MODE pages may be defined to 
provide additional control over the external protocol.

  The SCSI communications device is a target with the characteristics of a 
network access device, typically attached to a local area network (LAN), 
public telecommunications network, private telecommunications network, or 
packet switching network, etc., with no theoretical limits.  Such a 
communications device is often called a network node.  The communications 
device transmits or receives packets of data as requested by the initiator.  
The contents and meaning of the data packets is not defined by this standard.  
The bytes in the data packets may or may not contain addressing, path 
selection, or path control information identifying separate data streams.  
Additional information may be provided by the stream selection identifier 
found in the ten and twelve byte SEND MESSAGE and GET MESSAGE commands.

  In the SCSI communications device, the target accepts and provides the data 
packets transferred in accordance with commands received from the initiator.  
There is an assumption that the initiator and the communications device know 
the rules by which information is exchanged between them, how the information 
is to be interpreted by the communications device, and when it is allowable to 
exchange the information.  These rules are not specified by this standard.

  The initiator requests that the communications device accept a packet of 
data by transmitting a SEND MESSAGE command.  The initiator requests that the 
communications device return a packet of data by transmitting a GET MESSAGE 
command.  The communications device also supports commands related to 
configuration of the network access device and network management of the 
particular environment.  MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT are examples of these 
configuration commands.











  If a communications device temporarily has no resource available to handle a 
data packet from the initiator, or has no data packet to provide to the 
initiator, or has no resources assigned to perform the operation, the device 
may then choose one of the following responses: 
  (1)  Terminate the command with CHECK CONDITION status.  The sense key shall 
be set to NOT READY and the appropriate additional sense code for the 
condition.
  (2)  Disconnect until the necessary resource or data packet becomes 
available, and then reconnect to the initiator and resume the operation.
  (3)  Terminate the command with BUSY status.

  More than one logical unit  can be implemented by a communications device.   
logical units can serve as multiple paths to a single network access device, 
and/or each logical unit can serve as a discrete path to different resources 
within the device.  A single logical unit may also serve as a path to multiple 
resources if the communications device can interpret information within the 
data packet and route the packet to the appropriate resource.  If the logical 
unit addressed by the initiator does not have an available resource or data 
packet associated with it, the communications device may choose to treat the 
logical unit as an invalid logical unit (see section 6.5.3) or respond as 
described in the previous paragraph.

  If the communications device determines that an error or unusual condition 
has occurred while performing an operation specified by the contents of a data 
packet, the information describing the condition is normally returned as a 
part of a data packet from another network device.  If the communications 
device determines that an error or unusual condition has occurred while either 
executing the SCSI command from the initiator, or during a network medium 
access transaction, the command is terminated with a CHECK CONDITION.  The 
failures are identified through a REQUEST SENSE command.

  The SCSI communications device is distinguished from a SCSI processor device 
by the fact that the primary destination of the data packets transferred to 
the communications device is not the target device itself, but another network 
node.  A SCSI communications device passes the data on to an ultimate 
destination outside the target through a network.  In contrast, the SCSI 
processor device is itself the primary destination of the data packets.  
Devices requiring protocols and command sets that are totally incompatible 
with the communications device protocols should be examined carefully to be 
sure that the incompatibilities are based on functional requirements.  















17.1.1. Implementation Examples

  Several examples of communications device implementations are provided to 
clarify the range of utility of this device type.

17.1.1.1. Host to Host Communications 

  In this example of host to host communications only the SEND MESSAGE command 
is used.

  A communications device (Comm A) is attached to a network (Net A) and 
another communications device (Comm B)  is attached to a network (Net B).  
Comm A takes the initiator role and selects a communications device (Comm B), 
transmitting a packet to Comm B using the SEND MESSAGE command.  After 
transmitting the packet on the attached network medium (Net B), the action 
required by the SEND MESSAGE command, Comm B assumes the initiator mode and 
selects Comm A as a communications device and uses a SEND MESSAGE command to 
transmit a packet on the network (Net A) attached to Comm A.  Note that the 
SEND MESSAGE command is sufficient to perform complete transactions between 
communications devices if Comm A and Comm B act as initiators.  This provides 
the function of a network bridge or gateway for high bandwidth 
intercommunication among nearby host processors.

17.1.1.2. Host to Device Communications 

  In this example of host to device communications the SEND MESSAGE and GET 
MESSAGE commands are used.

  A host system, Host A, takes the initiator role and selects a communications 
device (Comm A) attached to a network (Net A), transmitting a packet on 
network Net A to some other network node(s) using the SEND MESSAGE command to 
Comm A.  Host A then assumes that a result will be obtained by the other 
network node(s) consistent with rules understood by all involved network 
devices.  Host A generates a GET MESSAGE command to obtain packets from other 
network nodes.  If there are no packets that need handling pending at Comm A, 
Comm A may disconnect until a packet arrives.  Comm A can then complete the 
transaction,  reconnect to Host A and the requested data packet can be 
returned to Host A.  Note that Host A need not support target mode and Comm A 
need not support initiator mode to successfully complete an exchange between 
the two devices.  The host system (Host A) can be replaced by communications 
device that is capable of acting as an initiator.

17.1.1.3. Multiple Role Communications 

  In this example of multiple role communications the SEND MESSAGE and GET 
MESSAGE commands are used.  The device acts as both a host and a 
communications device depending on its needs and the requests made in the 
network.

  A communications device (Comm A) is attached to a network (Net A) and 
another communications device (Comm B)  is attached to a network (Net B).  
Comm A takes the initiator role and selects a communications device (Comm B).  
Comm A transmits a packet for network Net B using the SEND MESSAGE command to 
Comm B.  Comm A then requests data packets from Net B by issuing a GET MESSAGE 
command to the Comm B device.  Following these actions, Comm B assumes the 
initiator role and transmits a packet using the SEND MESSAGE command to Comm A 
for transmission to network node(s) located on Net A.  Comm B then requests 
data packets from Net A by issuing a GET MESSAGE command to Comm A.

communications device.  An SCSI device whose principal function is to 
communicate with one or more other systems, usually over distances that exceed 
the maximum cable length defined for SCSI.

external medium.  The medium used by the communications device to send or 
receive information to or from one or more communications devices.  The other 
communications devices may or may not use an SCSI interface.

external protocol.  The protocol(s) used by the communications device to 
transfer information over the external medium.  The external protocol(s) are 
not defined by this standard.
