                             (and other SCSI Books)

   This file contains information on obtaining the various SCSI standards and 
   other published information about SCSI.  If you know of other published 
   material on SCSI that should be included here, please leave a message on 
   the SCSI BBS or send a Fax to John Lohmeyer 316-636-8889.

   American National Standard (ANSI) for Small Computer System Interface 
   (SCSI), X3.131-1986.  This approved standard is available from:

               American National Standards Institute
               11 West 42nd Street
               13th Floor
               New York, NY 10036
               Sales Department: (212) 642-4900

   The Small Computer System Interface - 2 (SCSI-2) was approved by ANSI on 
   August 31, 1990.  Since then, the X3T9.2 committee has asked ANSI to return 
   SCSI-2 for further editing.  Revision 10d is in the works, but it is not 
   finished yet.  Revision 10c can be purchased from:

        Global Engineering Documents
        2805 McGaw
        Irvine, CA 92714
        (800) 854-7179     Outside USA and Canada:  (714) 261-1455

   Global has identified this document as X3.131-199x. (The latest revision is 
   Rev 10c with a date of 3/9/90.)

   If you are looking for a introduction to SCSI, try:

        "SCSI: Understanding the Small Computer System Interface"
        Written by NCR Corporation
        Available from: Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632
        Phone: (201) 767-5937                ISBN 0-13-796855-8

   If you want an easy-to-read reference book on SCSI-2 that includes timing 
   diagrams (but omits all command sets other than for disks, tapes, and 
   processor devices), try:

       "The SCSI Bench Reference"
       ENDL Publications
       14426 Black Walnut Court
       Saratoga CA, 95070
       (408) 867-6642

   Also, coming soon from ENDL Publications, the "SCSI Encyclopedia".  I've 
   reviewed volume 1 and find it an excellent source of information about 
   SCSI-2.  Unfortunately, it is NOT inexpensive.
