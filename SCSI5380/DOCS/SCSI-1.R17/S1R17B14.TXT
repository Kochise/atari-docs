14. Status 

A status byte shall be sent from the target to the initiator during the STATUS 
phase at the termination of each command as specified in Tables 14-1 and 14-2 
unless the command is cleared by an ABORT message, by a BUS DEVICE RESET 
message, or by a "hard" RESET condition.

  A description of the status byte codes is given below:

GOOD.  This status indicates that the target has successfully completed the 
command.

CHECK CONDITION.  Any error, exception, or abnormal condition that causes 
sense data to be set, shall cause a CHECK CONDITION status.  The REQUEST SENSE 
command should be issued following a CHECK CONDITION status, to determine the 
nature of the condition.

CONDITION MET.  The SEARCH DATA commands shall return this status whenever a 
search condition is satisfied.  This status does not break a chain of linked 
commands.  The logical block address of the logical block that satisfies the 
search may be determined with a REQUEST SENSE command.

BUSY.  The target is busy.  This status shall be returned whenever a target is 
unable to accept a command from an initiator.  The normal initiator recovery 
action is to issue the command again at a later time.

INTERMEDIATE.  This status shall be returned for every command in a series of 
linked commands (except the last command), unless an error, exception, or 
abnormal condition causes a CHECK CONDITION status or a RESERVATION CONFLICT 
status to be set.  If this status is not returned, the chain of linked 
commands is broken; no further commands in the series are executed.

RESERVATION CONFLICT.  This status shall be returned whenever an SCSI device 
attempts to access a logical unit or an extent within a logical unit that is 
reserved for that type of access to another SCSI device.
