This the src directory for PML (Fred Fish's Portable Math Library)

Before you make the library
	- You must have atleast GCC V1.31
	- You should have applied all patches to the gcc library
	  (the ones that came with this distribution, and the one
	   that came with the gcc V1.31 upgrade).
	- You should have compiled the library again.

To make and install the library
	GCC-TOS	: use Makefile.tos
	GCC-MINIX : use Makefile.minix
In both Makefiles adjust CC and CROSSDIR to suit your environment.
