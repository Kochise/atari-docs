This the test directory for PML (Fred Fish's Portable Math Library)

Before you make the tests
	- You must have GCC > V1.31
	- You should have compiled the library again
	- You should have made and installed libpml.a in ../src

To make tests
	GCC-TOS	: use Makefile.tos
	GCC-MINIX : use Makefile.minix
In both Makefiles adjust CC to suit your environment.
