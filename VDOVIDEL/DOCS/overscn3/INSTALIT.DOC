This is how to install the Overscan :

Copy the OVERSCAN.PRG to Your auto-folder on Your harddisk or if You
don't have a harddisk copy it to Your boot disk into an auto folder.

Copy also the VIDEO50.PRG to the auto-folder to make sure Your ST will
start with 50 Hertz picture frequency in color mode. 

If You still have the old ROMTOS from 1985 inside Your ST, then copy
also a BETA-RAMTOS 1.4 or the Developer-RAMTOS 1.4 to Your boot disk
into the root-directory !
This disk has to have then a bootable sector, so that it will boot
automaticaly the TOS.IMG-file (BETA- or Developer-RAMTOS 1.4).

(If You already have the Blitter-TOS or the new (EP)ROMTOS 1.4 inside
Your ST, then You only have to have the OVERSCAN.PRG and VIDEO50.PRG
inside the autofolder and don't need an additional RAMTOS)

Switch the Overscan-switch to OVERSCAN and boot the disk or boot from
Your harddisk.

If You press the CONTROL-, SHIFT-, or ALTERNATE- key, the Overscan.PRG
will come up with an installation menu.
From this menu You can fit the screen resolution to Your monitor size
and still can save this, so Your ST will start up with the right size
the next time.
With key "P" You get the "Physebase"-emulator, so Calamus DTP works
now also !

In color mode: If You want to change from lowres to midres go to the
"change resolution"-menu from the GEM SHELL and click "okay" while
depressing the CONTROL-,SHIFT-, or ALTERNATE-key.Then the
OVERSCAN-installation menu comes up again and You can change to midres
and the other way around.
Use the arrow keys and the + - * /  keys to modify the size of the
Overscan screen.
The HELP key brings You back to the menu.
"S" saves the new screen size and "Q" quits the menu without saving to
(hard)disk.

Have fun with the Overscan,   Stefan Hartmann.
