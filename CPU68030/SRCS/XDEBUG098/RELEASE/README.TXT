XXX is no more - it is now X-Debug!

It's going commercial, so this is (hopefully) the final beta.

There's no more SmartHlp - if you want the extra amazing new manual
(rewritten to include pictures, index and features never before confessed
to) you'll have to pay for it! (probably œ24.95)	

Thanks to the name change, most filenames have changed, so be sure to
update your environment:

Was		Is Now
===		======
*.MON		*.XDB
(L)STARTUP.MON	(L)STARTUP.XDB
HELP.MON	HELP.XDB
STARTMON.VAR	STARTXDB.VAR
STARTMON	STARTXDB			(environment var)
MON.SCR		XDB.SCR

Please be sure to try the new utils too - subtle changes have taken
place.

Please report any problems ASAP.

Latest features:
Reg window shows more memory next to addr regs
SCREEN FONT tries to keep window posns same
'confirmexit' changed: positive value means always ask, negative
value means only ask if program loaded.
-sxxx on command line will load the script file xxx after all the others.
