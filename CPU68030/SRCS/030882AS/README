	Where can this package be used?

	This package was originally developed on a Sun system. As such it will
	work on Berkeley based Unix systems. It has also been ported to Apple's
	AUX environment. As a general rule, you can reasonably expect it to
	work in any Unix environment--it was designed for portability.
	No guarantees of course :-)



	Output file format. 

	This package does not include a linker/loader. The assembler generates
	S record format files. If your loader does not understand S records,
	modifications will have to be made.



	More information:

	Please refer to the spec file included with this package for more
	information about using the assembler. ENJOY!
