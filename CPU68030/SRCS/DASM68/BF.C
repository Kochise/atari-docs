This is indicated by the bfcommand when it reports where it started, where it stopped and what data it used. If the data is larger than the size chosen,then the begining of the data will be truncated to fit.The subroutine first checks to see if the number of arguments onthe command line is correct. Since <size> is optional, the allowablenumber of arguments on the command line may be 3 or 4.if the number of arguments on the command line are not correct,then drop down to the end of the program and print an error.If the number of arguments on the command line are correct, thenwe parse the command line.If at any time an error occurs in getting an argument, then wereturn to the main loop without changing any memory space.First we get the <size> from the command line (or have it set tothe default). Second we get the <range> from the command line. This involves getting a starting address and a count of the number of units of memory thatwill be filled. The range is specified as <addr>,<addr> then this is convertedto <addr>:<count>. This may mean the ending address is not the same asthe typed ending address as the block fill will not partially fill amemory area of demension <size>, but rather abreviate the area filled.Third we get the <data> from the command line. If there is more datathan <size> would permit, we will truncate later.If we get this far, then there will be no more chance of errorsfrom the command line. To tell the user what is going on, weprint the starting address that we will fill and the the ending address.Then we fill in the data by one of three tight loops. If the default caseis reached, then the getsize() routine made an error.The data fill loop starts by truncating any unneeded data from the frontof the data line. Next, a printout of the data used is made. Then, theassembly language routines are called that will put 8, 16 or 32 bits of datainto the memory area. As the data is inserted, then the address is read andcompared with the data. If the data written and the data read do not agree,then an error message is printed and the command returns to the main loop.If the data matches, the count is decremented and the starting addressis incremented by either 1, 2 or 4 bytes. Finally, a check is made to seeif the user has typed a cancel instruction. If so, then return with no furthermemory changed, though the memory already filled will remain changed.*//* **************************************************** */bfcmd(argc,argv)int argc;	/* number of arguments in the command line */char *argv;	/* the command line in ASCII */{extern int error;	/* global flag from getnum */register int size;	/* size of data to fill into memory*/register int start;	/* the starting address to begin fill at */register int count;	/* the number of 8, 16, or 32 bit increments to fill into memory */register int data;	/* the information to fill into the memory */	if (argc == 3 || argc == 4)	{		striparg(argv);		size = getsize(argv,ERR04);		if (size < 0)			return(0);		start = getnum(argv,ERR02,DEFAULTSCALE);		if (error)			return(0);		count = getcount(argv,size,start);		if (count < 0)		{			print(ERR02);			return(0);		}		data = getnum(argv,ERR03,DEFAULTSCALE);		if (error)			return(0);		print("Starting address: %c%8x\n",HEXDEL,start);		print("Ending   address: %c%8x\n",HEXDEL,start + count * size - 1);		switch (size)		{			case 1:				data = data & MASK8;				print("Data     entered: %c%2x\n",HEXDEL,data);				while (count > 0)				{					put8(start,data);					if(data != get8(start))					{						print("Memory fault at %c%8x\nData written %c%2x\nData read %c%2x\n",HEXDEL,start,HEXDEL,data,HEXDEL,get8(start));						return(0);					}					count--;					start = start + 1;					if(check())						break;				}				break;			case 2:				data = data & MASK16;				print("Data     entered: %c%4x\n",HEXDEL,data);				while (count > 0)				{					put16(start,data);					if(data != get16(start))					{						print("Memory fault at %c%8x\nData written %c%4x\nData read %c%4x\n",HEXDEL,start,HEXDEL,data,HEXDEL,get16(start));						return(0);					}					count--;					start = start + 2;					if(check())						break;				}				break;			case 4:				print("Data     entered: %c%8x\n",HEXDEL,data);				while(count >0)				{					put32(start,data);					if(data != get32(start))					{						print("Memory fault at %c%8x\nData written %c%8x\nData read %c%8x\n",HEXDEL,start,HEXDEL,data,HEXDEL,get32(start));						return(0);					}					count--;					start = start + 4;					if(check())						break;				}				break;			default :				return(0);		} 	}	else		print(ERR01);		}/* ****************************************************** */
