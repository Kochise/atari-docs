There are presently 2 versions of the monitor within this file.  The difference
between the two is how the versions expect the I/O to be handled.  The routines 
that handle I/O are getline.c and print.c.  There are 2 versions of each of 
these routines in this directory.  The versions with the "unix" suffix are 
designed to be used on a system which needs the putch() and getch() functions 
called to handle I/O.  The versions with the "port" suffix are designed to be 
used on systems where I/O is handled through a specific memory location (ie. the
location of the DUART on the target system).  

The errata shown below from version 1.0 has been noted and corrected.




ERRATA version 1.0 of the 68FBUG monitor:

1.  The rd command, when printing out the SR, displays this register as a 32 
    bit register.  Changing the "else if" statement on line 409 in the general.c
    file from:

		OLD
    409:	else if(reg[i].name[1] == 'S' && reg[i].name[2]=='R')

		NEW
    409:	else if((reg[i].name[0] == 'S' && reg[i].name[1]=='R') ||
    410:		(reg[i].name[1] == 'S' && reg[i].name[2]=='R')) 

    corrects this discrepancy.  If this change is not made then the lower 16bits
    actually displayed for the SR register correspond with the actual contents
    of the SR register.

2.  If .bss ram space is not intialized to '0' then use of the 68030 version,
    with NO coprocessor, of the monitor may crash (ie. continual "BUS ERROR" 
    loops) as a result of using the rd command.  This problem stims from 
    attempting to print the SR register in the printreg routine found in the 
    general.c file. Line number 413 of this file should be removed.

		OLD
    413:		i++;

		NEW
    DELETED

3.  The rm command, when printing out the SR, displays this register
    as a 32 bit register.  Changing the "if" statement on line 527 in the
    general.c file from:

		OLD
    527:	if(reg[i].name[1] == 'S' && reg[i].name[2]=='R')

		NEW
    527:	if((reg[i].name[0] == 'S' && reg[i].name[1]=='R') ||
    528:		(reg[i].name[1] == 'S' && reg[i].name[2]=='R')) 

4.  The rm command, when modifying a 16 bit register, allows these registers
    to be modified to contain values larger than 16 bits.  Then displays these
    values when executing either rm or rd commands.  Only the lower 16 bits
    are correct.  Modifying the printunix.c and/or printport.c routines as shown
    below corrects the display to only showing 16 bits.

    on powerup.
