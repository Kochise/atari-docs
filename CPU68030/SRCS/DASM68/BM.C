For example, if you needed to insert a line of code into memory,then you could clear out the appropriate amount of space with a blockmove, then use the line assembler to insert the new line. The move is not destructive to the area moved from, unless the <addr> moved to falls withinthe <range> moved from.The <size> is only used if the <range> is described as <addr>:count, not<addr>,<addr>. If <addr>,<addr> is used, then the <size> defaults tobyte. This means a faster block move can be made by using <addr>,<count>and specifying the <size> as 32 bits (L for 68k, W for 88K).The first thing done is to check to see if the right number of argumentsare on the command line. To many or to few results in an error.If the number of arguments on the command line are correct, then the "bm "is stripped from the start of the command line. Next the size option, if any,is obtained. A check is made to see if <range> is in the form of<addr>,<count>. If not then the size defaults to 1 byte so that getcountwon't truncate any of the <range>. The starting address, then the countis obtained. Finally, an address is obtained from the command line.If any of the command line arguments are incorrect, then an errormessage is displayed and no memory is moved. If all are correct, thenthe starting and ending address of the area from which the memorywill be used to the area the memory will fill.Now that the command line has been successfully parsed, the data willactually be moved. To ensure proper transfer, if the starting addressis lower than the address the memory data is being moved to, then thedata will be moved from high memory to low memory. Otherwise, thememory will be moved from low memory to high memory.The loop that does the actual memory move gets memory from the source location,puts it in the destination location. Moves the from address (start)towards the destination address. The count of the number if 1, 2 or 4 byteincrements of data is decremented and a check is made to see if the userhas type a halt or cancel. If a cancel is typed, then the move is stoppedwhere it is at but the memory already moved remains moved.the default case should never be reached if the getsize routine works properly.*//* ****************************************************** */bmcmd(argc,argv)int argc;char *argv;{extern int error;	/* global variable used by getnum to signal an error */register int size;	/* 1, 2 or 4 byte increments inwhich the memory will be moved*/register int count;	/* number of 1,2 or 4 byte increments that will be moved */register int start;	/* the starting address of the block move */register int addr;	/* the address to which the meory is to be moved */register int data;	/* a unit of data to be moved */	if (argc == 3 || argc == 4)	{		striparg(argv);		size = getsize(argv,ERR04);		if (size < 0)			return(0);		for (count=0;argv[count] != COUNTDEL && !whitesp(argv[count]);++count);			;		if (whitesp(argv[count]))			size = BYTE;		start = getnum(argv,ERR02,DEFAULTSCALE);		if (error)			return(0);		count = getcount(argv,size,start);		if (count < 0)		{			print(ERR02);			return(0);		}		addr = getnum(argv,ERR02,DEFAULTSCALE);		if (error)			return(0);		print("From : %c%8x - %c%8x\n",HEXDEL,start,HEXDEL,start + count * size - 1);		print("To   : %c%8x - %c%8x\n",HEXDEL,addr,HEXDEL,addr + count * size - 1);		if (start < addr)		{			start = start + count * size - size;			addr = addr + count * size - size;			size = -size;		}		switch (size)		{			case 1:			case -1:				while (count > 0)				{					data = get8(start);					put8(addr,data);					start = start + size;					addr = addr + size;					--count;					if(check())						break;				}				break;			case 2:			case -2:				while (count > 0)				{					data = get16(start);					put16(addr,data);					start = start + size;					addr = addr + size;					--count;					if(check())						break;				}				break;			case 4:			case -4:				while (count > 0)				{					data = get32(start);					put32(addr,data);					start = start + size;					addr = addr + size;					--count;					if(check())						break;				}				break;			default :				return(0);		}	}	else		print(ERR01);}				/* ****************************************************** */
