Return to the monitor isthrough a breakpoint, interrupt or simmilar exception.The "go " part of the command line is stripped off. Then a check is madeon the number of arguments. If argc equals 1, then insert breakpoints and usethe value in the pc set by rmcmd for a starting address.If argc equals 2, then either the -b option and no register was selected, ora register was selected. If argc equals 3, then -b and a register wereselected. If no register is selected, then a message prompting the user fora register name is issued. The register selected, either from the command lineor after the prompt, is then used to get a newvalue into that register. *//* *************************************************** */gocmd(argc,argv)int argc;	/* number of arguments on the command line */char *argv;	/* command line */{extern struct regelem mpu[];	/* table of mpu registers */register int start;		/* starting address to go to */extern int error;		/* global error flag from getnum */extern int regdata;	striparg(argv);	switch(argc)	{		case 1:			insertbr();			break;		case 2:			if (argv[0] != OPTDEL)			{				start = getnum(argv,ERR02,DEFAULTSCALE);				if (error)					return(0);				mpu[PC].value = start;				insertbr();			}			else if (argv[1] != 'b')			{				print(ERR04);				return(0);			}			break;		case 3:			if (argv[0] != OPTDEL || argv[1] != 'b')			{				print(ERR04);				return(0);			}			striparg(argv);			start = getnum(argv,ERR02,DEFAULTSCALE);			if (error)				return(0);			mpu[PC].value = start;			break;		default:			print(ERR01);			return(0);	}	prepreg(mpu);	putmpu();}/* *************************************************** */
